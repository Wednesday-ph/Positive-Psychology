is have the lecture on the mind body earlier.

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,770
Because it is such an important topic.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,390
It is so foundational,so basic that when I realized that-

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,880
and that was earlier on this semester that

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,280
I should have had it earlier,

to introduce it a little bit on a lower level of the spiral.

So today,you know,a month or two- too late perhaps,

But first,let me introduce- let me finish up on perfectionism.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,620
So remember last time we talked about the two models-

a straight line from point A to point B

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,210
a couple of people yesterday in office hours asked the question,

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,320
So you gave us the model of rat racer-

you know that person- remember- who at the age of 72,

"what kind of life do you want for yourself?"

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,450
So what is the alternative model? What is the positive model?

Now the positive model from the outside may look exactly the same

Because for very long time,

I couldn't,couldn't become less of a perfectionist

After we have awareness,

this mind set has been set in them from a very young age.

The fixed versus the malleable mind set.

was able to change their mind set.

I will become perfect person who is committed to excellence.

140
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,540

whether it's perfectionism,the fear of failure,
不管是完美主义 对失败的恐惧

148
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,630
whether it's anger that comes up once in a while,anxiety,
还是时不时出现的愤怒 焦虑

149
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,790
whatever it is that we have- that "issue".
不管我们的问题是什么

150
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,490
The Buddhists cognitively reframe it and say,
佛教徒很巧妙地重新定义了它

151
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,270
"we need to look at it as a tool,as a tool for growth,
"我们要将其视为一种工具 一种成长的工具

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,590
as a way of learning about ourselves,
一种了解自己的方式

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,470
digging deep inside ourselves and growing."
使我们深入挖掘自己 然后得以成长"

154
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,630
So to look at it- OK,so this is an opportunity for growth,
要这样看它 这是个成长的机会

155
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,960
for personal learning,for reflection,

156
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,470
for more empathy toward other people- whatever it is.
能够更设身处地为别人着想的机会 无论它是什么

157
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,390
But to look at it as a tool.
将其视为一种工具

158
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,120
Accept it.And then act.
接受它 然后行动

159
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,080
Can one of the TFs- do you mind seeing what it is,please?
有助教能查查看它到底怎么了吗

160
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,970
Thanks,John.
谢谢 John

161
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,440
The next thing,after we accept it,we go ahead and change it.
下一步 在接受它之后 我们就去改变它

162
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,410
And we go ahead and change it by introducing behavior.
我们要通过建立行为来改变它

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,610
The key issue here is behavior.
这里的关键在于行为

164
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,320
Now one of the things that I did as I told you last time
我上节课讲过的一件我做过的事

165
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,790
was started to solicit feedback from people,
就是向别人寻求反馈

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,110
started to solicit criticism.
寻求批评

167
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,990
Initially,literally I need to catch myself from responding,
一开始我要控制自己不去回答

168
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,540
from attacking back.
不去顶嘴反驳

169
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,640
Why? Because criticism is the deviation from a straight narrow,
为什么 因为批评是对直线箭头的偏离

170
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,190
from that schema.
偏离那个基模

171
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,490
But over time I got used to it.It actually helped me.
但我逐渐习惯了 这真的帮到了我

172
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,350
And now I'm much open to criticism.
我现在更能够包容批评

173
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:01,870
Still,
然而

174
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,810
sometimes catch myself when I want to respond and attack back.
我有时仍会想回答 想顶嘴反驳

175
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,730
But overall,I got better through behavior changing attitude.
但总体来说 我通过改变态度的行为变得更好

176
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,060
Something else- putting myself on the line more,
还有一点 使自己更经常处于水平线上

177
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,540
whether it's the story that I told you about Brittany,
包括我跟你们讲的关于Brittany的故事

178
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,770
who said no a few consecutive times.
连续说了几次不

179
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,890
And that's OK.So she said no.
但没关系 她说不

180
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,830
I'm still here.I survived.
我还在这 我还活着

181
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,980
Learn to fail or fail to learn.
屡战屡败 屡败屡战

182
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,080
Next,we don't always have to act out in the world;
下一步 我们不一定要外在地表现出行为

183
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,330
we can also act in our internal simulator-
我们也可以在内心中模拟

184
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,440
the mind doesn't know the difference
你的思想是无法分辨

185
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,560
between the real thing and the imaginary thing.
现实和想象的区别的

186
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,650
And therefore,I can imagine myself,see myself,
因此我可以想象自己 幻想自己

187
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,380
acting as a person committed to excellence.
就像一个追求卓越的人一样

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,760
So for example,before teaching,
比如说在上课之前

189
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,400
one of the things that I visualize
我想象的一件事就是

190
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,150
is seeing myself there on the stage,feeling light,
假想我自己站在台上 感觉很轻松

191
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,540
calm and accepting- in other words,
冷静 并且很包容 换句话说

192
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,530
a way that a person committed to excellence would,as opposed
想象追求卓越的人会用的方式

193
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,410
to a perfectionist would be constantly afraid of failure.
而非总是害怕失败的完美主义者

194
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,800
And the mind doesn't the know the difference
你的大脑是不会知道有什么区别的

195
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,020
and the mind looks for consistency.
你的大脑需要一致性

196
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,520
And therefore,I'm able to be that way
因此我就能那样去做

197
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,260
or much more likely to be that way because of the visualization.
或者更容易那样去做 因为我先幻想了

198
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,760
Also,meditation in and of itself helps.
同时冥想也会有所帮助

199
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,890
We'll talk about meditation- probably get to it on Thursday.
我们可能会在周四讲到冥想

200
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,910
Cause meditation puts us in a state of mind of calm,
因为冥想能使我们处于冷静的状态

201
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,290
of acceptance,a state of being,as opposed to state of doing.
能够接受事物 是一种存在 而非一种行为

202
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,770
And when we are in a state of being,we are here and now,
当我们作为一种存在时 我们就能活在当下

203
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,250
we are enjoying the process,
我们就能享受过程

204
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,500
as opposed to constantly thinking about the destination,
而不是总想着目的地

205
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,450
and what will happen if I don't get to that destination.

206
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,670
But more on that on Thursday.
周四我们会更深入地探讨

207
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,580
This is a technique,method that I learn from Samuel Coleridge,

And what Coleridge did- he had an issue with perfectionism

212
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,290
and perfectionism as Winston Churchill later on said

213
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,490
"means paralysis"-
"就是瘫痪"

214
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,440
and he experienced this paralysis when he came to writing.
他在写作时就经历了这样的"瘫痪"

215
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,730
Writing was the most important thing in his life.

216
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,030
But he really couldn't write well.
但他就是没法写好

217
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,230
Because he was so afraid of not writing the ultimate essay,

or the ultimate poem.

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,030
So here was what he did: he said,"well,at the end of my life,

220
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,820
I will write my magnum opus.

221
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,880
Until then,everything is rough draft."

222
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,940
And that liberated him.

223
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,540
Because he wasn't worried any more.

224
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,430
Now he never got to write his magnum opus.

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,140
But at the meantime,he wrote dozens of beautiful poems-

some of them the most beautiful in the English language

00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,020
And they were all "rough drafts".
而他们都只是"草稿"

230
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,860
So there wasn't the pressure.This helped me a lot.
这样就没有压力了 这给了我很大的帮助

231
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,210
Because what I do when I thought about this,I said,"OK.
当我想到这个时 我说 "好吧

232
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,400
So let's see one of the domains-

233
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,330
where perfectionism was very strong for me
对我影响最深的一个领域吧

234
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,880
because it was an important domain- was teaching."
因为这个领域对我很重要 就是教学"

235
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,390
Then I said to myself,"OK." And this was close to 10 years ago.
我就对自己说 "好吧" 这是大约十年前的事了

236
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,910
I said,"in 20 years,I'm going to have a leadership institute
我说"二十年后 我会在名列前茅的

237
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,350
in which I'm going to be teaching.

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,100
Amazing workshops and seminars and lectures.

Until then,everything is rough draft.
在那之前 一切都只是草稿

240
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,780
Until then,everything is preparation." And that took off...
在那之前 一切都只是准备" 这真的起作用了

241
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,780
Now I know this is a mental game.
我现在知道这是个心理游戏

242
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,570
I mean I know I am "fooling myself".
我知道我是在骗自己

243
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,650
Because in 12 years from now,when that goal is actually,

when I'm there 20 years later,

To liberate me so that I can enjoy the here and now.

So that I can enjoy the process,

248
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,930
as opposed to be stuck on it having to be perfect,

flawless everyday experience,which it can never be.

250
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,280

do not do unto others what you would not have done unto yourself"

The foundation of most moral systems,most religions today.

256
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,210
The Platinum Rule is taking the Golden Rule
铂金法则就是取自黄金法则

257
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,820
and switching it around.
再对其进行小小的修饰

258
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,550
And what it says is,
它说的是

259
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,890
"do not do unto yourself what you would not do unto others."

267
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,870
And do you love them any less for it? Of course not.
你们会因此少爱他们一点吗 当然不会

268
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,390
Then why do we apply these unrealistic

269
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,450
and non-compassionate standards to ourselves?

270
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,340

when he was first introduced to a lot of Western culture,

by our usage of a word,compassion.

278
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,950
And he was really taking back by the notion that in English

279
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,550
when we talk about,or in West in general- not just in English-

290
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,380
in people we love.
我们自己的失败

291
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:30,860
After all,why not? How do we help other people?
为什么不呢 我们是如何帮助别人的

292
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,350
Because very often when we are in relationships,
因为通常我们处于一段感情中时

293
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,870
people are in relationships with a perfectionist or,
和完美主义者有感情的人

294
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,510
we know a friend of ours is a perfectionist,
或者我们有个朋友是完美主义者的话

295
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,080
how do we help other people?
我们如何去帮助别人

296
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,200
The first thing that is important to make very clear is that
首先要搞清楚的一件重要的事就是

297
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,790
it is extremely difficult to help other people
帮助别人是非常困难的

298
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,130
deal with perfectionism.
处理完美主义的问题

299
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,110
It mostly has to come from within.
通常都要从内部着手

300
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,040
They have to want a change.
他们必须要渴望改变

301
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,000
Because it takes time.
因为这是需要时间的

302
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,750
Doesn't happen over night.
不是立竿见影的

303
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,610
I know it from research or I know it from personal experience.
我从研究中 或者个人经历中了解到这一点

304
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,090
And yet,we can help,after accepting that it is difficult.
但我们还是能去帮助他人 即使知道这很困难

305
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,440
The first most important thing to do is by example.
首先最重要的事就是树立榜样

306
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,760
If I can change,
如果我能改变

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,730
and become more a person committed to excellence,
成为一个追求卓越的人

308
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,290
enjoy the journey,celebrate even failures,
享受过程 即使失败也要庆祝

309
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,570
even falling down once in a while.
即使偶尔挫折也要庆祝

310
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,930
Then I'm leading by example.
那我就做出了榜样

311
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,950
And remember that experiment,right?
还记得那个实验吧

312
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,420
People do what you do,rather than what you say.
人们更愿意照着你所做的去做 而不是你说的话

313
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,730
Second thing to do is to tell stories about it,
第二件事就是分享这个故事

314
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,690
which is what this lecture is essentially,
也就是这门课

315
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,000
the last two lectures were about-
上两节课所讲的内容

316
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,090
mostly,personal stories of how I moved or am moving
基本上是关于我个人如何从

317
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,250
from being a perfectionist to being committed to excellence.
完美主义者变为追求卓越者的故事

318
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,180
So telling stories,sharing.
讲故事 互相分享

319
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,990
Again,the difference between sharing and telling:
再次强调分享和讲的区别

320
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,410
sharing,both of us get; telling is one way street.
分享 两者皆有收获 讲就只是单行道

321
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,670
And finally,another way to,to help other people
最后还有一种帮助别人的方式

322
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,140
is remembering what Carol Dweck was all about.
回忆一下Carol Dweck的研究

323
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,880
Rewarding effort.Rewarding the journey.
工作回报 过程的回报

324
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,240
It is so easy to fall into the track of rewarding outcome,
很容易陷入对结果的回报之中

325
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,580
and so easy to forget to reward the journey.
也很容易忘记回报过程

326
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,110
I know that's difficult in child rearing with my kids.
我在抚养我的小孩时就觉得很困难

327
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,630
And it's certainly difficult in a relationship.
在感情之中也很难做到

328
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,190
It's certainly difficult being the boss or a friend.
作为上司或者朋友当然也很难

329
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,330
But to really focus on rewarding the journey,
但一定要注意回报过程

330
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,700
on pointing out "oh this was a great attempt"
要指出来"这是个不错的尝试"

331
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,710
or "this was so much fun doing it"- the process.
或者"这真是太有趣了" 注重过程

332
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,280
I want to end this lecture
我想通过做一个

333
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,430
by introducing a mini summary of the course so far.
对至今为止所讲内容的小小总结来结束这个话题

334
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,770
This is a technique- quite a simple technique,
这是个技巧 一个很简单的技巧

335
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,720
but a technique that I found very powerful.
但我发现是个很有用的技巧

336
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,110
Because what it does is synthesize a lot of what we discussed
因为它能够整合我们目前为止所见过的

337
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,970
until now in the course.
所有内容

338
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,170
And this specific technique I apply to difficult situations
我将这个技巧应用于各种困境中

339
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,620
when I'm facing periods in my life and it could be a long period
当我在面对人生中很困难的一段时期 可能是很长的一段时期

340
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,210
or one day that is very difficult for me.
也可能是很困难的一天时

341
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,670
You know,when I'm experiencing anxiety or stress,
当我感受到焦虑或压力

342
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,670
or strong levels,or high levels of disappointment.
或者深深的失望时

343
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,350
And this is the alternative in many ways to the three Ms-
这是除了三个M之外的另一种选择

344
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,700
so remember the three Ms? Magnifying.Minimizing.
还记得三个M吗 放大 减小

345
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,880
And Making-up,inventing.
以及编造 发明

346
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,180
So the three Ps are the alternative.
三个P则是另一种选择

347
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,860
The first p is the Permission to be human.
第一个P就是准许自己为人

348
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,420
So if I experience a difficult experience,I have some...
如果我经历了困难

349
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,210
I go through a hard time.
我遇到了挫折

350
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,820
The first step is to give myself permission
第一步就是给自己许可证

351
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,330
and that would mean accepting of the emotion,
也就是说接受这样的感情

352
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,480
accepting that is difficult,accepting reality.
接受这个困境 接受现实

353
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,830
Something just happened;
它已经发生了

354
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,780
there is nothing I can do about what had just happened.
我对此什么也做不了

355
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,810
What can change is perhaps my interpretation of what had happened
能够改变的只有我对它的诠释

356
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,030
which is where I get to the next level.
这时我就会进入下一个层次

357
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,900
The next step.
到下一步

358
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,850
And this is reframing,interpreting the situation as Positive.
也就是重建 将情况诠释为积极的

359
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,990
And that would be the benefit finder.
这就是积极者

360
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,900
What's the silver lining here?
这其中有什么闪光点

361
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,370
What is the growth opportunity here?
其中有什么成长的机会

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
So if I am going through a very difficult time,
所以如果我经历了困境

363
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,700
perhaps look at it through the Buddhist perspective and say,
也许可以用佛教的眼光来看待

364
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,280
"well,this is a tool for growth;
"这是成长的工具

365
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,770
this will help me better understand myself as well as others,
这可以帮助我更好地了解自己 了解他人

366
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,370
become a better psychologist,become a better business person,
成为一个更好的心理学家 成为一个更好的商人

367
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,550
whatever it is.
诸如此类

368
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,310
Seeing it again,the silver lining,the opportunity in failure.
再次发掘出失败中的闪光点 失败中的机会

369
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,400
And finally,
最后

370
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,660
one very important technique that we didn't talk about much,
我们没怎么提到的一个非常重要的技巧

371
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,160
just in passing,is distracting,distraction;
就粗略提到过的 就是分心

372
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,720
is looking toward other place.
将注意力转向别处

373
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,860
It's not always good.In fact,
这不一定是件好事

374
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,570
we will talk about next time it's sometimes detrimental to stay
我们下节课会讲到 有时执着于

375
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,020
and analyze every single emotion,feeling,thought that comes up.
分析每种情感 感觉和想法 是有害的

376
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,010
Ruminating in and of itself does not always help.
反复思考并不一定有帮助

377
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,180
Sometimes the best thing to do
有时最好的方法

378
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,870
is when a negative thought comes up,
就是当消极的想法

379
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,600
or a negative feeling comes up
或者负面的情绪出现时

380
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,850
is to distract ourselves from it by,for example,
将我们的注意力转到别处去 比如说

381
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,690
going to listen to a piece of music,going for a run,
听听音乐 跑个步

382
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,560
talking to someone either about that or something else.
和别人聊聊这件事或者别的事

383
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,120
Now this is very different from avoiding.
这和逃避是很不一样的

384
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,740
Because it is not about saying,"all right,
因为这并不是说 "好吧

385
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,100
I am not going to deal with any of the issues in my life."
我一辈子不要再管这种事了"

386
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,650
It's just saying that if there is a recurrent thought or feeling,
这只是说如果某种情绪或想法反复出现

387
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,780
and I'm experiencing a Sisyphean battle against it- you know,
我永远都在徒劳地抗争

388
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,290
pushing the stone up and being pushed down again,
把石头推上去 然后又被推下来

389
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,840
up and down again.
上上下下

390
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,700
Sometimes it is better,more helpful to just say,
有时更好 更有用的方法是

391
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,370
"OK,I'm not going to ruminate; it's pointless.
"好吧 我不要再反复想了 这没有意义

392
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,720
This neural pathway in my mind is being so reinforced.
这个神经通路在我脑海中太强烈了

393
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,380
It's not going anywhere." And then to say,"let me move on.
不会有任何出路的" 然后说 "让我继续前进吧

394
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,830
Let me listen to a nice piece of music.
让我去听首好歌

395
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,120
Let me go for a run that will really help get my mind off this."
让我去跑个步 好让我能够真正忘记它"

396
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,440
And very often
很经常地

397
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,450
what a run can do is also help me look at it in a different,
跑步还能使我从全新的角度

398
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,100
through a different lens.
来看待这件事

399
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,940
And we'll talk about it,much more about this distraction,
我们会更深入地探讨这个分心

400
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,010
because it's nuanced,meaning we are not about avoiding.
因为差异非常微小 并不是逃避

401
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,820
So we'll talk about it next,
我们下节课

402
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,410
on Thursday when we talk about dealing with depression
周四讲到处理沮丧

403
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,160
or dealing with anxiety,using meditation,
或者焦虑时 会用到冥想

404
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,540
using mindfulness as a kind of distraction.
用念来分心

405
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,070
But that's also one way of looking at the positive.
但那也是一种积极对待的方式

406
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,340
And finally,the third p is about taking Perspective.
最后 第三个P是指换个角度

407
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,650
Is this really gonna matter?
这真的很重要吗

408
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,560
This is Richard Carlson's wonderful self-help book,
Richard Carlson写了一本很好的自助书

409
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,100
"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff... and it's all Small Stuff".
"别为小事伤神 一切皆是小事"

410
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,040
Now I don't necessarily agree with the second-
我不完全同意后半句

411
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,300
"it's all small stuff",but certainly
"一切皆是小事" 但很显然

412
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,840
a lot of things that we sweat about in our lives are small stuff.
许多生活中我们为之伤神的事都是小事

413
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,350
Now the issue with not sweating the small stuff
要不为小事伤神

414
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,760
is asking a simple question: is this going to matter in a year?
就要问一个简单的问题 它在一年后会不会有影响

415
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,390
Or in a grand...
或者更久...

416
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,170
You know,in a large schema of things,does it really matter?
从长远来看 它真的很重要吗

417
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,050
Is it worth my worrying,and fretting,
它真的值得我去担心 焦虑

418
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,120
and being depressed and upset and anxious about this now?
为之沮丧 为之焦躁吗

419
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Is this really going to matter in a year?
它在一年之后真的会有影响吗

420
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,310
And most of the times,it won't matter.
通常情况下都不会

421
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,420
The other side of this is that well,then does anything matter?
从另一方面说 有什么是真的重要的吗

422
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,340
A few years ago,I was asked a very simple question by a friend.
几年前 有个朋友问了我一个非常简单的问题

423
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,090
And he said,"you know,just..."
他说

424
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,890
You know we haven't talked about before- this was a close friend.
我们之前从来没聊过这个的 他是我很好的朋友

425
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,950
But..."Can you tell me what psychological maturity is?
但也没聊过 "你能告诉我心理成熟是什么吗

426
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,570
From your research,
通过你的研究

427
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,120
can you think about what psychological maturity is?"
你能想明白心理成熟到底是什么吗"

428
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,260
And off-the-cuff,
就在这一霎那

429
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,620
at that moment- over time I revise the definition a little bit-
就在当时 后来我又对这个定义做了些修饰

430
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,840
I said the following: Psychological maturity
我当时这么说 心理成熟

431
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,670
is about the ability to willingly shift perspective.
就是根据自己的意愿转换角度的能力

432
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,430
And I think it's more or less right.Again,
我觉得这差不多是对的

433
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,430
looking at the research about this ability to shift perspective.
基于这些关于转换角度的能力的研究

434
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Why? Or what is this ability to shift perspective?
为什么  这种转换角度的能力是什么

435
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,750
It's the ability when we want to be immersed in the here and now,
这就是我们希望沉浸在当下的

436
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,330
in the present.
一种能力

437
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,990
And it's the ability to,when we want,take a step back,
也正是我们退一步

438
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,960
zoom out both in time and in space,and ask the question,
时间和空间上都退一步 问这样的问题

439
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,450
"is this really going to matter? Or in a year?
"它真的有影响吗 一年之后呢

440
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,290
Or in a grand schema of things,space? Is this really important?"
或者更长远来看呢 它真的很重要吗"

441
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,100
And at the same time,go back almost at will.
同时随心所欲地回来

442
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,710
Have this flexibility to go back

443
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,810
and be immersed when listening to a beautiful piece of music,

444
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,340
or spending time with people we love.

445
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,510
And again,it's easier said than done.
说起来容易 做起来难

446
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,690
But over time,we can train our mind through meditation,

447
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,880
through cognitively reframing things.

to be able to make that shift almost at will.

450
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,980
So let me give you an example of the three Ps applied.
我来给你们举个应用三个P的例子吧

451
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,830
So this happened to me at the beginning of the semester,
这是刚开学时发生在我身上的事

452
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,170
about two weeks into the semester.

And you know what I like to do before lectures is to work out.

456
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,360
Now I realized I was not going to have time to work out,

457
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,450
I hardly had any time to go over the lecture notes that

458
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,060
I do twice in the morning before the lecture.

And I got upset.And I became stressed.

460
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,920
Then I said,"OK.Let's take the three Ps and apply them."
然后我说 "就用用三个P吧"

461
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,200
First P,permission.Acceptance.

463
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,280
It's OK to be upset.It's OK to be stressed.

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:16,020
Even if you do teach positive psychology.It's all right."
即使你是教积极心理学的 也没关系"

The second thing that I said- respect for reality.

This is the beginning of the semester.
这是学期刚开始的时候

467
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,520
A lot of things are happening.

We had just arrived from Israel a couple of weeks earlier.

A little bit of jet lag.The kids.

471
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,670
And then I moved on to positive.
然后我转向第二个P 积极性

472
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,700
So what's the benefit here? So the first benefit is- well,

473
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,210
I need to think more about where I can simplify,

what I can say no to.

476
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,730
Because it got me thinking about it.

477
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,440
The second benefit that I thought about at that moment-

"oh now I have another story to tell in class.

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,170
Is this really going to matter a year from now that

484
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,740
I didn't exercise before a class
我在上课前没有锻炼

485
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,510
and that I didn't go over lecture notes twice

486
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,800
but only once before class?

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,080
So I'm not gonna give a class which is 95 percent,

488
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,810
but just 90 percent.

489
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,010
Is this really going to matter? No.
这真的很重要吗 不重要

490
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,750
But at the same time,I said to myself,

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,500
"I still want to be able to enjoy the here and now."
"我仍然希望能享受当下"

492
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,890
So I took my time,spent time with Shirell,

493
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,670
stayed with her a few more,

extra minutes in day care- we played together,

495
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,540
and then went home,much more relaxed,much calmer,

496
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,450
having applied the three Ps to an actual situation that arose.

Focusing on the positive- benefit finding.
关注积极的一面

499
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,950
And finally,the ability to shift perspective-
最后就是转换角度的能力

500
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,950
when do I want to zoom out and ask this,
我什么时候要退一步问自己

501
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,760
"do I need to sweat over it now?

502
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,510
And when do I want to be immersed in the here and now?"

503
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,160
Think about this technique.And again very simple.
想想这个技巧 非常简单

504
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,680
Now this technique is not equivalent to an inoculation,
这个技巧并不等于可以一劳永逸

505
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,740
meaning it's not OK- now you learn the technique;

I know about the three Ps.

Now for the rest of my life,it's going to help me.

508
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,920
That's not how it works.
它并不是这样

509
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,080
It works much more like a pill-
它更像是一种药丸

510
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,380
that you need to take on a regular basis,
你要经常定期服用

511
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,630
meaning if you are going through a difficult time,
也就是说每当你经历一次困境

512
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,500
apply the three Ps.
就应用三个P

513
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,220
And the more you apply them,the faster it is.

514
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,720
Now very often as I mention,the term three Ps.
正如我所说的 三个P

515
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,790
Already automatically I go through that process.

Permission.Positive.Perspective.It's much faster now.

Because I used it.Because I practiced it.

So use it constantly.Try a few times.

535
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,850
And he said,"you know,the problem with psychology today

536
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:36,830
is that our focus has mostly been neck up,

and most of what happens to us is neck down.

Now hearing this was very important for me.

541
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,360
It was double important hearing

00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,440
from Martin Seligman for various reasons.

First of all,Martin Seligman has always been ahead of the game.

That means he really studied this phenomenon

What it is saying though that

824
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:59,000
we need to perhaps first ask whether exercise is,
我们首先要问的是锻炼

825
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,420
or lack there of is the underlying reason for the experience.
或者缺乏锻炼是不是其潜在原因

826
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,470
Now why should not we do away

827
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,740
if the results are very similar between exercise and medication?

828
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,550
Why shouldn't we do away with medication? Here is why.
我们为什么不废除服药呢 原因在于

829
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:19,520
You see,let's say...Let me just draw this circle.
比如说 让我画一个圆

830
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,460
No.Let's say
假设

831
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:26,060
this is the total population of people who are depressed.
这是所有抑郁的人的集合

832
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,660
We know that Zoloft,
我们知道左洛复

833
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:34,000
or antidepressant medication helps about 60 percent of them.

And we know that exercise also helps 60 percent.
我们知道锻炼同样帮了60%的人

835
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,120
However,it is not the same 60 percent.
但不是同一个60%

836
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,540
There is overlap by definition,
在定义上有重叠

837
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,330
because it is more than 50 percent.
因为多于50%

838
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,430
But it doesn't help the same people.
它们帮助的不是同一群人

839
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,780
So there are people who are only helped by medication;
有的人仅仅受了服药的好处

840
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,890
there are people who are only helped by exercise;
有的人仅仅受了锻炼的好处

841
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,090
and there are people who are helped by both.
还有的人两者好处皆有

842
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,130
So it's not saying let's do away with medication.
所以不能说 废除服药吧

843
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,200
It is important.It helps.
它很重要 它确实有用

844
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,830
However it also says "let's try exercise,
但结果同时显示 "试试锻炼吧

845
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,790
because I may be helped by exercise and not medication,
因为我有可能是得益于锻炼而不是服药

846
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,750
or I may be helped by both.
或者得益于两者

847
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,600
Here is the clincher though in the study:
研究的关键在于

848
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,210
so what we are looking for,as I look in all these studies,
我们在看这些研究时 想搞清楚的是

849
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,920
is the relapse rates,meaning 6 months after the end of the study
复发率 实验结束半年后

850
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,730
when we no longer give medication,

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,570
when we no longer push the participants to exercise

852
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,120
three times a week at least,what happens after 6 months?

853
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,750
And here is what they found:
这是他们发现的结果

854
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,310
the relapse rate of the group on medication only-
仅仅服药组的复发率只有

855
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:59,180

60%多好转的人中有38%人回头

the group that did medication

858
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,310
and exercise- relapse rate of 31 percent,

859
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,600
just under a third of the 60+ percent who got better;

860
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,000
relapse rates of the exercise group only-
仅仅锻炼的组的复发率

861
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,200

862
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,790
that was entirely up to them-
完全看他们自己

863
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:33,040
the relapse rate of the exercise only group,9 percent.
仅仅锻炼的组的复发率 为9%

864
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,930
Remarkable results.
十分令人惊讶的结果

865
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,850
Similar results earlier than the year 2000,
和2000年之前的实验结果非常相似

866
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,020
all the way back in 1984 for dysthymia.
追溯到1984年的精神抑郁症

867
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,950
Dysthymia is usually longer lasting,
精神抑郁症通常持续时间较长

868
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,650
but less acute form of depression.
但没一般抑郁症那么急性

869
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,270
So it's a deep feeling of sadness.
是一种深层的悲伤的情绪

870
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,440
Lasts for much longer than major depression.
比抑郁症持续时间长很多

871
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,480
But also exercise helps this.
但锻炼对它也有帮助

872
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,170
Now when I first saw this study again there are dozens,
在我第一次看到这个研究时

873
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,010
there are hundreds of studies by now,
现在已经有无数这样的研究了

874
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,380
replicating this phenomenon on different,
在不同的领域重复这样的现象

875
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,740
different areas- as I'll talk about in a minute,
我等下会讲到

876
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,690
I said,"wow! This is amazing!"
我说 "哇 太不可思议了"

877
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:17,720
So exercise is like taking antidepressant- seems like it.
不锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药 效果很像

878
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,890
Exercise is like taking antidepressant.
锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药物

879
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,410
But when I thought about further,
但我再仔细想想

880
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,160
I realized that wasn't the case.
就发现并不是这样

881
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,500
It's not that exercising is like taking an antidepressant,
不是锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药

882
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:34,340
it's rather that not exercising is like taking a depressant.
而是不锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药

883
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:40,410
This is more than just a semantic difference.
这不仅仅是语言上的区别

884
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,670
This is more than just a semantic difference.
这不仅仅是语言上的区别

885
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,160
Why? Because you see,we weren't made to be sedentary.

886
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,240
We weren't made to sit in front of the computer

887
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:50,450
or in the classroom.

888
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:55,320
We were made to run after that deer or run away from that lion.
我们本来应该去逐鹿 或者逃离狮子的追捕

889
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,570
And we frustrate a need,as we've talked about earlier,
而当我们无法满足这种需求时 正如之前讲的

890
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,140
we frustrate a need,we pay a price.
我们无法满足需求 就要付出代价

891
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:08,290
So let's say our God-given or genes-given level of happiness,
比方说上帝或者基因决定的幸福程度

892
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,530

894
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,530
When we don't exercise,

00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,800
what we are doing is that we are lowering that base level to here

896
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,480

we are lowering it to here.

899
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,780
And then whereas we could have lived our life up here
然而我们是可以达到这样的幸福程度的

900
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,350
with all the vicissitudes,and hopefully upward spiral,
即使有兴衰变迁 也可能是螺旋式上升的

901
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,960
what we are doing is we are living our lives
而我们现在是经历了

902
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,910
the same ups and downs- only a much lower level here.

And we struggle just to get to our God-given

906
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,520

because they don't have the motivation perhaps to exercise.

or to make it a top priority.

00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:50,790
We all have a genes/God-given level of weight,
我们都有一个基因决定的体重水平

1008
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,430
of the right weight for us.
适合我们的体重水平

1009
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,820
Now when we exercise,we are there.
当我们锻炼时 我们在那儿

1010
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,400
And that is healthy.That is where we should be.
这样就是健康的 是我们应该达到的

1011
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,980
When we don't exercise we are going above this weight.
当我们不锻炼时 体重就会超过这个

1012
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,030
Just like we go below our base level of well being.
就像降低幸福水平一样

1013
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,830
In other words,what exercise does
换句话说 锻炼的作用

1014
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:13,250
is simply bring us back to where we are supposed to be all along,
就是将我们带回我们本来应有的水平

1015
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,270
which explains why most diets fail
这也就解释了为什么大多数节食

1016
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,830
if not associate with physical exercise as well.
如果不和锻炼一起进行 就很容易失败的原因

1017
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,430
Because our bodies will always fight to go back to the base level
因为我们的身体会拼命想要回到原来的水平

1018
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,220
to where we are supposed to be.
我们本该有的水平

1019
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,360
And if we don't exercise,we will struggle even harder.
如果我们不锻炼 就会挣扎得更辛苦

1020
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,170
Chronical disease,whether it's diabetes,
慢性疾病 不管是糖尿病

1021
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:40,330
whether it's heart disease,whether it's cancer.
还是心脏病 抑或是癌症

1022
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:44,440
Once again numbers are staggering,absolutely staggering.
数量是非常惊人的

1023
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,530
Diabetes,certain types of diabetes were only experienced
糖尿病 有些糖尿病原本只有45岁以上的人

1024
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,180
by people 45 years and older.
才会获得

1025
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:56,790
Today kids in elementary school are getting this kind of diabetes
现在小学生都会得这种糖尿病

1026
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,370
and the association is mostly
其原因很大程度上就是

1027
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,690
because of nutrition and lack of exercise.
因为营养问题以及缺乏锻炼

1028
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:04,440
People who exercise
经常锻炼的人

1029
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,320
are much less prone to these chronical diseases.
更不容易得慢性疾病

1030
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:11,280
Reducing significantly the likelihood of diabetes;
患糖尿病的可能性大大降低

1031
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:18,650
reducing by 50 percent or more the likelihood of heart failure

1032
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:23,560
and the likelihood of certain kinds of cancer.
以及得癌症的可能性

1033
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,900
By over 50 percent reducing their likelihood-
可以降低50%的可能性

1034
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,850
again,a wonder drug.
它是灵药

1035
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,360
People who exercise regularly have a stronger immune system.
经常锻炼的人免疫系统更强

1036
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,420
Well I have to prep you for this.
我要给你们打好提前量

1037
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,680
And finally if you haven't been convinced until now,
最后 如果你现在还没被说服

1038
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,880
hopefully this will convince you.
希望这个能说服你

1039
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,660
(Better Sex) Both men and women.
(更好的性行为) 不管男人还是女人

1040
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,490
Strengthens libido- their sexual desire;
都能增强性欲 对性的渴望

1041
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:05,890
enhances the likelihood of orgasms.
能够增加高潮的可能性

1042
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:14,200
People who exercise more regularly have more and better sex.
经常锻炼的人性生活会更美好

1043
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,070
Again,a lot of research showing this.
很多研究都证实了这一点

1044
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,050
And by the way,this applies to all ages.
它适用于任何年龄

1045
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:30,730
To all ages.Well,not all ages.I hope.21 and on.
不是任何年龄 21岁以上

1046
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,940
Now the important thing to remember about exercise-
但是关于锻炼要记住的很重要的一点是

1047
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,080
it is not a panacea.
它不是万灵药

1048
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,710
It's not a fix-all.
它不是万能的

1049
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,880
Remember not everyone benefits from exercise.
记住不是所有人都能从锻炼中获得好处

1050
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,530
There are some people for whom medication
对于有的人来说 服药就是

1051
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:47,970
is absolutely the right thing and it's important.
很适合和很重要的方式

1052
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:54,410
However,in many situations,and it's eveident by,by literature,
然而在很多情况下 研究和调查都证实了

1053
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:58,700
by research- in most situations,exercise can help.
在大多数情况下 锻炼是有帮助的

1054
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,970
Even it's not on its own.
就算不是它本身的作用

1055
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,770
Even in conjunction with something else.It helps.
即使是和别的东西协同作用的 它还是有帮助

1056
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,430
And again why fight nature? Why fight it?
为什么要和自然对抗呢

1057
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,540
Nature to be commanded must be obeyed.
自然所要求的必须遵守

1058
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,510
What's very important is recovery.
还有很重要的一点在于恢复

1059
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:20,730
Let me read you something that
我给你们读读

1060
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,130
Dienstbier and Zillig write about in the Handbook
Dienstbier和Zillig在《积极心理学手册》中

1061
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,230
of Positive Psychology to researchers in the field: "
对研究者们这样写道

1062
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:30,130
Repeated workouts that are too intense to allow complete recovery
"重复的过于密集的训练 以至于没法及时恢复

1063
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,540
may cause endurance athletes to experience 'staleness,'
可能会导致运动员感觉到'泄气'

1064
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:35,310
a syndrome that is characterized
典型的症状为

1065
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,880
by increased psychological symptoms of anxiety
更高的焦虑水平

1066
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,800
with increased sympathetic nervous system,
更高的神经紧张度

1067
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:44,180
catecholamine,and cortisol base levels."
更高的儿茶酚胺和皮质激素水平"

1068
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,780
Now what they are saying here
他们想说的是

1069
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,510
is that there can be too much of a good thing.
有时事情是过犹不及的

1070
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,270
And this is especially important for perfectionists to understand
尤其是完美主义者要明白这一点

1071
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,920
It doesn't mean that more is always better
越多不一定代表越好

1072
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,050
when it comes to exercise.
说到锻炼的话

1073
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,730
There is too much- and some of the symptoms of overtraining
确实会过度锻炼 有些过度训练的症状

1074
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:06,970
are very similar to the symptoms of undertraining.
会和训练不足的症状十分相似

1075
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,720
Higher levels of anxiety,higher levels of staleness,
高水平的焦虑 高水平的泄气

1076
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,960
lack of motivation,
失去动力

1077
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,270
as well as ultimately could lead to depression.
最终也可能导致抑郁

1078
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,440
This is a symptom of a perfectionism.
这是完美主义的一种症状

1079
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,670
This is something that I experience when I was an athlete-
我在做运动员时就经历过这样的事

1080
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:24,960
overtraining,not recovering enough,and paying the price.
过度训练 恢复不足 并为此付出了代价

1081
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,450
Physically of course with injuries,but also psychologically.
身体上自然是受了伤 而且心理上也受了伤

1082
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,170
What I recommend is between 1 to 4 days of rest a week.
我推荐每周有一到四天的休息时间

1083
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,110
Ideally you want to exercise 5 or 6 times a week;
理想情况下你想每周锻炼五到六次

1084
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,490
at minimum I would say every other day.
我认为至少要保证每两天一次

1085
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,910
So it could be 3 or 4 days a week.
这样每周就是三到四天

1086
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,080
At minimum every other day.
至少每两天一次

1087
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,880
Ideally you may want a little bit more than that.
理想状态下你们可能想更多一点

1088
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:58,700
Each time,about 30 minutes; could go all the way up to an hour.
每次半小时 也可以增加到一小时

1089
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,930
The key here is to listen to your body.
关键是要听从你身体的需要

1090
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,330
If your body is hurting
如果你的身体很痛苦

1091
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,890
beyond the slight discomfort of exercise which is natural,stop.
超出了正常的不舒适范围 赶快停止

1092
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,970
If your muscle hurts,stop.
如果肌肉开始酸痛 停下来

1093
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,200
Or on the side of too little rather than too much.
宁可少也不要过度

1094
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,230
Also one of the ways to listen to your body
还有一种聆听你身体的方法

1095
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,740
if you are not as sensitive to it,
如果你没那么敏感的话

1096
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:24,300
is putting on a heart rate monitor,
就是戴个心率监控器

1097
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,480
which is something not very expensive,very useful,very helpful.
不是很贵 但非常非常有用

1098
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,950
So I know my exercise
这样我就知道我的锻炼

1099
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,630
would be around 70 percent of maximum heart rate.
会保持在最高心率的70%左右

1100
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:39,970
70 percent of maximum heart rate for me is about 128.
我最高心率的70%大概是128

1101
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,340
So exercise around between 120 and 135.
于是我就在120到135之间锻炼

1102
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,380
And then once in a while I also introduce interval training,
偶尔我又会加强一点

1103
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,240
while I go all the way up to 90 percent,
达到90%

1104
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,960
which is about 165 heart rate for me.
我的差不多是165

1105
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,930
But very easy to find out about you know what your heart rate is-
很容易发现你们的心跳

1106
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:00,480
usually maximum heart rate is around 220 minus your age.
通常在最大心率是220减去你的年龄

1107
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,670
So if you are 20 your maximum is to 200.
所以如果你20岁 最大心率就是200

1108
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,700
Mine,being 37,is 183.
我37岁 所以就是183

1109
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:08,340
Again,more or less.
差不多吧

1110
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,300
And then you want to be around 70 percent of it.
然后你就保持在70%的水平

1111
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,740
65 percent to 75 percent of it
65%到75%的水平

1112
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,920
for moderate effective benefit of exercise.
来获得锻炼的最温和的效果

1113
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,180
And to keep in mind that the quantity does affect quality.
记住数量确实会影响质量

1114
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,560
And once again we have the graph that
我们再次画个图表

1115
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,380
we see so often: the curve linear relationship.
我们经常看到的线性曲线图

1116
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,660
So if on this side of the graph,
在图的这边

1117
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,380
we had psychological plus physiological benefit,
是心理和生理的好处

1118
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:48,910
and here we have effort or amount of work,
这里是运动量

1119
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:54,410
the graph looks like this,where too little effort is not good.
那么图画出来就是这样 太少了不好

1120
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,170
We are compromising on our base level of happiness.
我们要达到基本的幸福水平才行

1121
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,030
Too much effort is also not good.
太多了也不好

1122
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,360
That's when we experience the staleness and the anxiety.And
这时我们就会感到泄气和焦虑

1123
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:08,160
what we want to get to is more or less around our optimum level.
我们想要达到的是差不多到最适水平

1124
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,000
And also optimum level given how much time we have.
而这个最适水平也在于我们能投入多少时间

1125
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,120
Yeah,in an ideal world,
在理想情况下

1126
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:16,810
I would work out six times a week for one hour each time.
我每周锻炼六次  每次一个小时

1127
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,100
In an ideal world.But I want to do many other things.
在理想情况下是这样 但我还想做很多别的事

1128
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:24,490
So I exercise at least 4 times a week,30 minutes each time.
所以我每周至少锻炼四次 每次半小时

1129
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:29,930
It's good enough for me.Identify what's good enough for you.
这对我来说就足够了 要搞清楚什么对你是足够的

1130
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:36,990
Recovery is important.
恢复也很重要

1131
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,140
We talked about recovery on the psychological level.
我们从心理学层面上讲过恢复

1132
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:40,390
Recovery is very important.
恢复很重要

1133
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:45,930

as high as the top runners in the world.
没有其他世界级选手那么高

1144
