00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,900
more than anyone else what a true benefit finder is.

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,740
And when I told about my grandmother,I told the...

I told you how she wasn't ignoring what wasn't working,

However,the same time,she refused to ignore the positive.

In other words,what she insisted on was staying real.

Being real. Being connected to what was around her.

And when it was evil and bad,

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,100
she was connected to that and at the same time,

48
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,350
she was also connected to the good.

50
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,890
Far from it. The question we asked last time-

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,140
and I want to end the lecture today on gratitude

52
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,980
before we move on to change- was: one,

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,920
why are not more people benefit finders?
为什么没有更多的积极者?

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,140
Why are more people not optimistic?

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,630
I mean,you saw the research. People live longer.

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,680
They are happier,healthier,more successful.

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,040

in both the ultimate currency- the currency of happiness

61
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,760
as well as in hard currency- success currency?

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,570
Why are not more people benefit finders?

63
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,700
And the answer to that was,to great extent,
问题的答案 在很大程度上

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,050
because of the media.
是因为媒体的原故

65
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,840
What we have in the media is magnifying,zooming in,
媒体正在放大 聚焦

66
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,140
magnifying the negative,maximizing it,

while minimizing the positives.

And in many ways,the media makes fault finders out of us.

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,790
And we need to counter that. How do we counter that?

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,360
On the macro level,by having good news channels,for example.

72
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,740
On the micro level,by having more inspiring art.

at the transition to the Renaissance,

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,220

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,110
in many ways of Hollywood,bringing more hope to people.

81
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,510
and hopefully,will continue to do so.

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,760
So then we talked about the global level,the macro level.

for something external to happen for us to be grateful.

87
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,050
Because when we are grateful,by definition,

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,710
we don't take something for granted.

And we shared the readings and the research on gratitude.

if you want to do it once a week,

it's better to do it once a week mindfully

than doing it every day and taking it for granted.

That's when you transform your thinking.

And if you do it every day,the key is to vary,

119

"if the stars would shine once in a thousand years,

we would all look up and praise the glory of this world.

For children,that dosen't exist.

124

And part of the reason why it dosen't exist

125
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,410
is that because they don't think automatically,conceptually.

They think more perceptually. Or sensually.

And we can do it simply by visualizing.

That will not in and of itself make you a benefit finder.

You need to do it. You need to experience it.

you'll begin to see more and more of the positive in the world

287
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,580
Don't take it for granted. Express it.

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,910
Again,write it in a letter or by phone or in person.

289
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,870
One of the most effective interventions out there today
当今最有效的一种干预形式

290
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,480
is expressing gratitude to others especially this one:

291
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,180
writting a letter of gratitude and then visiting the person to
写一封表达感激的信然后去拜访

292
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,810
whom you are writting and reading them the letter.
收信人 再把信读给他们听

293
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,380
Cheesy? I agree. A little bit embarrassing? Sometimes.
俗气? 同意 难为情? 有时是的

294
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,700
You cannot imagine the kind of result
你无法想像

295
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,610
that people get when doing just this gratitude visit.
人们做感激拜访时获得的结果

296
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,340
But even if you don't visit them,

297
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,680
you do feel self-conscious doing it. I do recommend it.
你觉得害羞 我建议去拜访

298
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,940
But you feel self-conscious,

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,500
send the letter,make that phone call.
那就把信寄出去再打电话

300
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,200
And before,just think for a few minutes,

301
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,550
"what am I going to say? What am I really grateful for?"

302
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,940
Again,whether it's to your parents,

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,080
whether it's to your friends,

whether it's to your 1st grade teacher. Just do it.

Whether it's to your coach. The largest largest peak,boost,

spike in wellbeing when we are expressing gratitude to others.

307
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,650
Quite remarkable if you think about it.
想想吧 相当不可思议

308
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,890
And if you think about it further,it is a win-win.
进一步思考会发现它是双赢的

309
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,690
Because obviously you get the benefit-
因为显然你从中得益

310
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,500
this is what the research shows. We feel good when we express it.
研究已证明了这一点 表达感激时我们感觉很好

311
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,000
and the other person feels good too. They benefit a great deal.
对方也会感觉很好 他们的获益良多

312
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,560
So you are creating a win-win and an upward spiral,because
于是你创造了一个双赢的局面 一个上升的螺旋

313
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,920
that person is then more likely to express gratitude to others.
因为对方也更可能向他人表达感激

314
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,700
The best way to lead it by an example:
最好的方法是以身作则

315
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,170
be the change you want to see in the world,as Ghandi said.
成为你期许见到的改变 如甘地所说

316
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,760
So you want people to be more grateful?

317
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,810
Express gratitude yourself.
先以身作则表达感激

318
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,650
They are more likely to then take it on
他们才可能承接下去

319
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,600
and express gratitude to others. So not only you
向他人表达感激 你不仅仅

320
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,270
start an upward spiral between you and that person,
在你和对方之间启动了一个上行螺旋

321
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,170
but also potentially between that person as well as others.
对方和他人之间可以承接上行

322
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,540
Paying it forward. Paying it forward.
传递出去 传递出去

323
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,870
The downside of this intervention is
这种干预的不利之处是

324
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,420
while it leads to a spike in well-being,
虽然它能让幸福感达到峰值

325
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,270
that spike usually goes away after about a month.
但一个月后 幸福感会消退

326
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,640
It varies: it can go away after a week or after three months.
时间不同 可能是一周或三个月后

327
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,870
But the average it goes away after about a month.
但平均来说一个月后会消退

328
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,530
The spike to well-being.
幸福感的峰值

329
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,410
So the key you want to maintain the spike is to do it regularly.
保持这个峰值的关键就是经常去做

330
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,970
Either once a week. Once a week,two weeks. Once a month. Do it.
每周做一次 两周做一次或一月做一次

331
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,960
You can do it one week a gratitude phone call and make it ritual.
一周打一次感激电话 把它变成仪式

332
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,630
The next week,a gratitude letter.

333
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,550
The week after that,a gratitude visit. Or something like that.
再下一周 感激拜访 以此类推

334
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,410
Again,variety. Variety really helps here.
还是要有变化 形式的变化很有帮助

335
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,210
But do it regularly as a ritual.
但把它作为一种仪式经常去做

336
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,000
And when we talk about change next week,
下周谈"改变"时

337
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,680
we'll talk about the importance of rituals.
我们会谈到"仪式"的重要性

338
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,800

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,470
that's the only change for real,lasting change.
那是唯一的真正持久的改变

340

that Sonja Lyubomirsky found.

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,590
What she found is that if we write that letter,

343
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,220
we get the spike in wellbeing even if we don't send it.
就算不寄出去 幸福感也能达到的峰值

344
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,940
Obviously if we send it and we get feedback,

345
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,600
the spike is even higher.
峰值会更高

346
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,650
But just the act of writting it,of being grateful,being open,
但仅仅是书写 感受感激之情 敞开心扉

347
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,330
that in and of itself contributes to wellbeing. Next week,
这样做的本身也有助提升幸福感 下周

348
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,610
your response paper is going to be a letter of gratitude,

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,550
I want to go a little bit more in depth into

00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,400
what helps in therapy more than anything is less of technique,
心理治疗中最有帮助的 除了技术

430
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,360
less the years of study that the therapists had,
除了心理治疗师的多年学习

431
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,610
less the experience that the therapists had. These things matter.
除了心理治疗师的经验 这些都很重要

432
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,290
But not that much. What matters most is are they empathic.
但不是最重要的 最重要的是他们的感同身受

433
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,930
In other words,are they good listeners? so
换言之 他们是不是好的聆听者?

434
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,730
when we feel like we can talk and analyze about painful emotion,
当我们觉得可以谈论或者分析痛苦情绪时

435
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,630
we feel better. We are physically healthier.
我们感觉更好 身体更健康

436
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,240
When we simply sit down
当我们只是坐下来

437
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,260
and ruminate about painful emotions without making sense of it,
沉思痛苦的情绪却不去理清它时

438
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,890
we get very often into a downward spiral.
我们经常进入下行螺旋

439
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,800
We narrow and constrict. We feel more sad.
我们收窄压缩 感觉更悲哀

440
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,020
We narrow and constrict even more.
进一步收窄压缩

441
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,120
Remember the Barbara Fredrickson's studies?
还记得Barbara Fredrickson的研究吗？

442
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:41,600
And so on and so on. In contrast,we are not sure why.
不断恶化 相反 虽然不清楚原因

443
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,140
when we analyze a positive experience,really analyze it-
当我们分析积极的经历时 真正地分析它

444
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,270
try to understand why it happened and so on.
尝试理解为什么会发生等等

445
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,720
So we do it for three consecutive days.
连续这样做三天

446
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,030
It actually dosen't help. We don't understand why.
它确实没有帮助 我们不明白为什么

447
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,640
But maybe it's because it takes all the fun spontaneity
也许是因为让我们回忆起

448
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,480
from the experience.
经历的快乐之处

449
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,610
However when we just ruminate about the positive experience-
但当我们只是沉思积极经历时

450
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,120
just think about it,then it contributes to our well-being.
只是想也会提升我们的幸福感

451
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,470
The gratitude exercise is about replaying the experience.
感激修习就是重播快乐经历

452
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,500
It's exactly that. In other words,
就是如此 换言之

453
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,740
it's thinking about our happiest experiences of the day,
就是说回想最快乐的日子

454
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,740
which leads ultimately to positive outcome.
能自动导致积极的结果

455
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,180
So what is it saying aobut the permission to be human?
那么准许为人说的是什么?

456
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,700
How is it different?
有什么区别?

457
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,110
Because the permission to be human is also very much related
因为准许为人也是为了

458
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,520
to being happier and healthier in the long term.
实现长期的快乐和健康

459
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,920
Well here's the difference: with the permission to be human,
区别是这样的 准许为人

460
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,210
we give ourselves the permission to experience the emotions
我们准许自己感受各种情绪

461
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,980
for as long as necessary.
只要有必要

462
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,960
If we just lost someone,it would be much longer
失去亲人时 我们准许自己感受情绪的时间

463
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,590
than if we just didn't perform so well in the test. But
远比考试失利的时间要长

464
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,050
we give ourselves the permission to experience the experience.
但我们准许自己感受经历

465
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,520
And then we ask ourselves,
然后我们自问

466
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,450
"so what would be the most effective way to act now?"
"现在最有效的行动是什么?"

467
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,230
And one fo the most effective way to act
最有效的行动之一

468
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,720
would be to share that experience.
是去分享那次经历

469
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,220
One fo the most effective way to act
最有效的行动之一

470
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:08,090
would be to just write in our journal. Daily active acceptance.
是写日记 接受每天的行为

471
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,460
Not just ruminating and staying there with this painful emotion.
不要苦苦沉思痛苦的情绪

472
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,070
Now one of the things I thought about it
我思考的一件事

473
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,120
also in the context of my grandmother's experience
也与祖母的经历有关

474
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,320
is why is it that- we'll talk about PTSD in a few minutes-

475
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,160
why is it that
为什么会那样

476
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,600
so many people in the United States coming back from Vietnam

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,050
30% of Vietnam vets experience post traumatic stress disorder.

478
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,220
It affected their entire lives.

479
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,010
Whereas people who have been through the holocaust,
但经历过大屠杀的人

480
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,410
no less terrible experiences,very often,much worse experiences,

481
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,620
people who have been through the holocaust,percentage wise-
经历过大屠杀的人 就百分比来说

482
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,610
there are far less people who have PTSD-
患有PTSD的要少得多

483
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,040
post traumatic stress disorder. Why this difference?
严重创伤后遗症 为什么会有这种区别?

484
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,300
I mean,you know in Israel,50% of the older population-
我知道在以色列 50%的老年人

485
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,390
when I was born,50% of the population were holocaust survivers.
在我出生时 50%的人口都是大屠杀幸存者

486
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,130
I didn't see much post traumatic stress disorder there.
我没看到有很多严重创伤后遗症患者

487
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,610
Whereas again,30% of Vietnam vets have PTSD.

488
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,860
Now the jury is still out to see

how many of the second Iraq war will come back with PTSD,

491
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,650
Why? What's the difference?
为什么? 为什么有这样的区别?

492
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,890
And I think this explains the difference.
我认为这就是解释

493
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,240
You see,Vietnam is not a popular war.
越战是遭到反对的战争

494
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,890
Many of the vets who came back to their home,

495
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,290
to their country didn't talk about it openly.

it helped them move on and continue.

one we analyze; the other,we simply replay.

Being grateful shouldn't wait for Thanksgiving.

And B,because it's moral.

537
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:55,620
Again,just like a child. The poet,Galway Kinnel:
就像一个孩子 诗人Galway Kinnel写道

538
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,510
"To live and die in gratefulness,if in no other virtue."
"感激地活着和死去 若无其他美德"

539
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,110
Cicero: "Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues,
Cicero写道"感激不仅是最大的美德

540
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,120
but the parent of all others". Why is it parent of all others?
也是其他美德的发源" 为什么是其他美德的发源?

541
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,270
I thought about this sentence a lot which I love,but why?
我经常想起这句最爱的话 但是为什么?

542
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Because if you think about it,if we are not grateful,
想想吧 如果我们不知感激

543
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,460
then we take things for granted.
我们就会将事情视作理所当然

544
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,880
If we are not grateful for the good things in our lives,
如果我们不知感激生命中美好的事物

545
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,290
things are taken for granted. And then we are blind to them.
认为它们理所当然 那就会对它们视而不见

546
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,430
Then as far as we are concerned,they do not exist.
对我们来说 它们是不存在的

547
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,710
Now what makes virtue virtuous? It's the good.
美德为什么是高尚的? 是它的好

548
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,510
And if there is no good in our world,
如果世上没有好

549
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,960
then that takes away the virtue from being virtuous.
那么美德将不再高尚

550
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,350
That is why I think...
所以我认为...

551
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,290
what Cicero was talking about when he meant

552

Let's recap some of the things that we discussed.

"well it's not really impossible and futile",

857
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,670
Yeah we experience it an up after we get tenure
在哈佛得到终身职位 或考入哈佛后

858
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,070
or after we get into Harvard,and we experience a down
我们的幸福感上升 当我们遭到拒绝时

859
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,060
when we are rejected by whatever it is. But
经历下行

860
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,640
then very quickly we go back up to our base level of wellbeing.
但很快我们又恢复到幸福感的基准线上

861
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:22,610
And most of our life
人生的多数时候

862
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,670
looks like this around this straight base level.
幸福感都是在基准线上下波动

863
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,880
It's very difficult to get an upward trajectory.
获得上升抛物线很难

864
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:35,780
It's possible through coping for example,but it's difficult.
通过去面对可能做到 但很难

865
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,230
The Cambridge-Somerville study-
剑桥-萨默维尔研究表明

866
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:44,540
5 year intervention that ultimately led to negative change,
五年的干预 最终导致消极改变

867
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:46,600
whether there's more alcoholism among the people
即使有最好的心理学家 心理治疗师

868
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,960
who did go through that intervention with bright in the best.
社工和各种计划进行干预

869
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,630
Psychologists,psychiatrists,social workers,programs.
实验人群中还是有更多人酗酒

870
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,590
So we know change is hard,
我们知道改变很难

871
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,470
whether it's on the individual level or on the society level.
不论是个人还是社会层面

872
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,320
However,we also know the change is possible.
然而我们也知道改变是可能的

873
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,130
We know that many of the people who argue that change
我们知道很多人争辩说

874
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,140
is not possible are making the error of the average,
改变是不可能的 他们犯了普遍性的错误

875
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:22,300
looking at the average score as opposed to outlayers,
只看平均分而不看例外情况

876
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,280
as opposed to people who have introduced change.
不看那些实现改变的人

877
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,640
And when we study change,it's the exception that proves the rule
当我们研究改变时 是例外证明了改变是可能的

878
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,580
So if change is possible and some people have been able to change
如果改变是可能的 有些人实现了改变

879
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,820
whether it's through therapy,whether it's by reading a book,
或者是通过治疗 读一本书

880
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,330
whether it's being a part of the class,
参加学习

881
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,970
whether it's through conversation-
或者是通过交谈

882
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,830
sometimes it's a single sentence
有时只需要一句话

883
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,690
that makes a difference to their entire life,
就能改变他们的整个人生

884
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,410
they are the exceptions. But
他们是例外

885
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,240
the questions are no longer whether or not change is possible.
但问题不再是改变是否可能

886
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:52,390
The question is "how is change possible".
问题是"如何才能实现改变"

887
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,740
And this is the question we are going to address in much greater
这个问题我们将在讲座中

888
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,920
depth on a higher level of the spiral in these lectures.
更深入在更高层次上讲

889
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,410
What does change look like? Let's go micro here.
改变是什么样的? 我们从微观上说

890
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,130
Let's go to the brain level. How does change actually look like?
去到大脑的层面 改变到底是什么模样的?

891
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:28,290
What happens in our brain when change occurs? Until 1998,
改变发生时 我们的大脑有什么变化? 直到1998年

892
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,800
neuro scientists thought that the brain was essentially fixed.
神经科学家认为大脑是不变的

893
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,330
We are born with certain neurones,certain pathways.
我们生来具有一定的神经元 一定的通道

894
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:46,040
The brain doesn't grow,dosen't change pass the age of,say three
大脑在三岁之后不会生长 不会改变

895
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,260
Maybe first a few experiences the brain still changes and evolves
开始时大脑可能会改变发展

896
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,410
But after the age of three,no change.
但三岁之后 不会再改变

897
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,020
And this theory which was held until 1998-
这个理论直到1998年仍站得住脚

898
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:59,640
I mean that's not so long ago,this theory gave credence,
也就是在不久以前 这个理论让人相信

899
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,660
and actually proved positive for
并实际证明了

900
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,500
"happiness is a stochastic phenomenon".
"快乐是随机现象"的正确

901
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,150
You are born with certain genes.
你生来具有一个的基因

902
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,330
You are born with certain inclinations
生来具有一个的倾向

903
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,410
with certain neurone pathways.
具有一定的神经元通道

904
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,960
You have a few experiences that really affect you a great deal,
有一些经历对你产生深刻影响

905
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,360
as Freud argued. And then the rest of your life,
正如弗洛伊德的论点  而剩下的人生

906
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,520
you are going to just fluctuate around that same level.
就是围绕那个水平波动

907
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,880
No change. That was until 1998. In 1998,
不会改变 直到1998年

908
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:32,600
scientists started to notice that the brain actually does change.
科学家开始发现大脑其实是改变的

909
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:37,700
And they came up with the concept of neuroplasticity.
并得出神经可塑性的概念

910
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,150
Neuroplasticity are nuerones are plastic- they change.
神经可塑性是指神经元有可塑性 它们会改变

911
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,060
Not only that,not only do the pathways change in the brain-
不仅如此 不只大脑的通道会改变

912
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,620
and we'll look at it in a minute,
一会我们就会看到

913
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,290
but also they've come up with another concept,
他们还得出另一个概念

914
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,850
which is neurogenesis. Neurones develop,
即神经形成 神经元是发展的

915
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:57,620
are created throughout our lives until the day we die potentially
在人的一生中不断生成 直到我们死去

916
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:58,870
So it's not the fact that
因此 事实并不是

917
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,630
we are born with certain number of neurones
我们生来具有一定的神经元

918
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,470
and it's downhill from there,
然后就一直走下坡

919
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,450
as conventional wisdom had us to believe-
传统的认识让我们相信这种说法

920
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,230
as many people still believe today.
今天仍有很多人相信这种说法

921
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,720
No,neurones are developed and grow,emerge throughout our lives.
不 神经元是发展生长的 在人生过程中不断出现

922
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:19,470
The brain,it turns out,in many ways is like muscle:
原来大脑在很多方面很像一块肌肉

923
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,680
use it and you don't lose it. Use it and you generate,
使用它就不会失去它 使用它能让它再生

924
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,650
you build the muscle up. And the question is
让肌肉更发达 问题是

925
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,410
how do we use it so that it becomes an assistant in a way,
要如何使用它 才能让它帮助我们

926
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,510
help toward becoming happier.
变得更加快乐

927
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,750
So let's look at what the brain actually look like.
我们来看看大脑到底是什么样子的

928
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:44,060
What it looks like is that there are millions of channels inside,
大脑里有数以百万计的通道

929
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,530
neural pathways,connections between different neurones in brain
神经通道 不同神经元在大脑里的连接

930
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,340
that look something like this.
看上去就像这样

931
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,840
As you can see,some are very thin,are relatively new.
你们能看到有些很薄 是新生的

932
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,770
some are much thicker,much more established.
有些更厚 更健全

933
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,850
And the way it works in many ways is like in nature.
它作用的方式很像自然界

934
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,880
You have large rivers,large channels.
即有大河 宽敞的渠道

935
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,080
And you have tiny rivers and tiny channels.
也有小河 狭窄的渠道

936
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,840
And what happens is that
原理是这样的

937
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:20,610
every time a connection is made between neurones- in other words,
每次神经元之间发生联系 换言之

938
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,490
your thought pattern follows a certain path.
你的思维模式有特定的路径运作

939
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,400
That path grows.
那个路径会成长

940
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,310
Just like a river- every time the water passes there,
像河流一样 每次有水流过

941
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,730
it gets this much,this much wider.
河流都会变得宽一些

942
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,260
And when there is no water there,
没有水的时候

943
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,280
there is no work being done in the neurone,
神经元不工作时

944
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,420
metaphorically speaking,it shrinks a little bit.
打个比方 它会萎缩一点

945
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,170
So neural pathways grow with use
使用时神经通道得到扩展

946
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,520
and they shrink when there is no use.
不使用时就会萎缩

947
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,030
If it's something new,a new neural pathway that
如果一条新的神经通道刚刚生成

948
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,530
was just created because remember- there's neuroplasticity.
因为神经是有可塑性的

949
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,070
Neural pathways are created constantly. There is neurogenesis.
神经通道不断生成 因为有神经形成

950
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:04,900
New neutrones are created constantly. Initially it's very thin.
新的神经元不断生成 开始时很薄

951
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:10,410
Let's say for example,I study French. And I learn a new word.
举个例子 我学法语 学了一个新词

952
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,240
A new connection is made in my brain.
我的大脑里形成新的联系

953
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,290
Now if I hear the word once and never again,
如果我只听了这个词一次

954
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:23,590
the neural pathway will disintegrate,will disappear. However,
神经通道会分裂 会消失

955
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,900
if I continue hearing that word over and over and over again,
如果我不断重复听到那个词

956
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,010
after all it will become thicker and thicker.
最后通道会变得越来越厚

957
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,950
Ok this is a way over simplification of the real process.
我说的比实际过程简化得多

958
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:35,030
But it will become thicker.
但它会变得更厚

959
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,130
And then I'll remember it for the rest of my life.
我就会一生记得这个词

960
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,810
It will be established like a river that is established,
就像形成了一条新的河流

961
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,670
as opposed to a tiny stream and trickle
不再是涓涓流淌的小溪

962
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,490
that can disappear in a day.
可能在某一天消失

963
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,220
And here is the key aspect for understanding
这是我们理解改变思维的

964
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,670
how we can change our thought,
关键方面

965
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,780
how we can change our wellbeing ultimately.
并最终提升我们的幸福感

966
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,590
The neural pathways are self-reinforcing,just like rivers are.
神经通道会自我巩固的 像河流一样

967
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:06,130
Think about it: when it rains,when there is a down pour,
想一想 下雨时 下倾盆大雨时

968
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:10,480
the water gravitates toward the existing river,
水流向已有的河流

969
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,780
toward the channels,toward the drains that we have built.
流向渠道 流向我们建好的沟渠

970
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,480
It's much less likely to create a new river
如果之前什么都没有

971
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,330
or a new stream with there's nothing before.
那么形成一条河流或小溪会更难

972
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,540
So the experience is much likely to gravitate to
我们的经历也更倾向于流向

973
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:34,400
already established neural pathways and strengthen it further,
已建成的神经通道并进一步加固它

974
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:37,580
as opposed to create new neural pathways,
而不是生成一条新的神经通道

975
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:39,780
which is why if we want to remember something,
所以如果我们想记住什么东西

976
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,100
it's very good to make connections to other things,
和其他东西产生联系是个很好的方法

977
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,540
to existing neural pathways,to existing memories.
和已有的神经通道 已有的记忆产生联系

978
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,000
Let me explain this again,
让我再解释一次

979
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,120
because this is important to understand.
理解这一点很重要

980
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,020
Because understanding this can actually...
理解这一点 其实...

981
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,290
this is something that Carol Dweck,professor at Stanford showed
这是Carol Dweck 斯坦福的教授的研究结论

982
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,440
and understanding this neuroplasiticity,
理解神经可塑性

983
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:01,360
understanding how we actually can change can make us
理解我们如何实现改变

984
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,500
more likely to succeed in one of the ways of success-
能让我们更容易成功

985
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,920
to actually become happier. So it's important to understand.
能让我们更加快乐 理解这一点很重要

986
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:13,780
And established neural pathway attracts more action
已建成的神经通道吸引更多活动

987
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,130
and it attracts more action and gets thicker.
从而变得更厚

988
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,730
Something that's not established,
没有建成的通道

989
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,890
a tiny little stream is more likely to be just wiped away.
一条小溪更容易消失

990
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,030
As it grows more,it's more likely to stay,
当它变得更宽 就更可能保留下来

991
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,440
not just stay,grow even more.
不仅保留下来而且能继续生长

992
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:36,660
It is self-reinforcing. And this is what habits are.
它是自行巩固的 习惯就是如此

993
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,210
When something is reinforced over and over again,
一种做法被反复巩固

994
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:43,940
it becomes a habit. For example,you play tennis
就变成一种习惯 比如打网球

995
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,100
and you hit the forehand over and over and over again.
你反反复复运用正手击球

996
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,810
Initially you have to think about it. You have to concentrate.
开始时你要考虑怎么打 必须集中精神

997
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,730
You have to,you know,maybe cock your wrist a little bit,
手腕翘起来一点

998
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,860
maybe understand exactly where you stop the racket,
知道球拍应该停在哪里

999
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,910
but after a while, after doing it hunderds of, thousands of times
但一段时间之后 挥过几百几千次后

1000
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,040
you don't need to think about it anymore.
你不用再考虑怎么打

1001
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,610
It's already grooved. And the word that I used is grooved,
它已经刻成槽 我使用"刻成槽"这个词

1002
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:10,480
specifically because you essentially created a new channel.
因为事实上你创造了一条新渠道

1003
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,870
And whenever a ball comes toward you,
只有有球飞过来

1004
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,030
automatically you don't even need to think about it.
你不需要再考虑

1005
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,210
It gravitates.
它被吸引

1006
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:22,040
Your mind gravitates toward that particular path or paths,
你的思维被引向那个或那些特别的通道

1007
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,100
many paths that tell you "lift it up and hit".
很多通道 告诉你"举起球拍击球"

1008
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,130
It's automatic. Same with music.
完全是自动的 音乐也是如此

1009
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:33,320
And what it has shown is people who practice music regularly
经常练习演奏的人

1010
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,130
or practice a sport regularly,
或经常练习一种运动的人

1011
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,950
their brain actually changes its shape.
他们的大脑真的会改变形状

1012
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,600
More neural pathways are created around these areas
更多神经通道在那个区域形成

1013
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:44,240
that mean "let me play a C now"
"让我演奏C调"

1014
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,790
or "let me move my fingers in this way"
"让我的手指这样移动"

1015
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,750
based on somthing that I see on the page.
根据我看到的乐章

1016
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,790
Certain neural pathways are created,
特定的神经通道被创造出来

1017
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,900
and the brain actually becomes thicker in these areas.
大脑在那些区域变成更厚

1018
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:59,060
Or more experience flow in: the more we do it,the more they flow
更多经验流入 做得越多 经验流入的越多

1019
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,600
Until it becomes grooved
直到它变成沟槽

1020
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:06,400
and I don't need to think about how to play C-.
让我不需要考虑就能演奏降C调

1021
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:13,090
It's automatic. They did a research.
完全是自动的 他们做过一项研究

1022
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,070
This was the first research,one of the first research projects
这是做过的首批研究中的一项

1023
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,310
where they found the brain actually changes.
让他们发现大脑其实是改变的

1024
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:23,350
They took taxi drivers or freshly minted taxi drivers from London
他们让伦敦的出租车司机或新手司机

1025
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:27,400
And what they had to do,to become,to get their certificate,
他们如果想获得执业证

1026
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,740
their approval,they had to study the map of London.
他们的许可 他们必须学习伦敦地图

1027
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:33,920
Now the map of London is much more complicated
伦敦地图

1028
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,540
than study the map of New York.
比纽约地图复杂得多

1029
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,680
Those of you who have been to London.
去过伦敦的人都知道

1030
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,350
But they studied and they spent a lot of time.
但他们花很多时间研究地图

1031
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,980
What they found was the brain,
他们发现司机们的大脑

1032
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,410
part of their visual cortex actually changed from
他们的视觉皮质的一部分发生变化

1033
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,190
before they started to study the maps of London to after.
在司机学习伦敦地图前后

1034
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,390
Because they were working that part of the brain.
因为他们在使用那部分大脑

1035
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,190
They had experiences.
他们有经验

1036
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,870
And these experiences created grooves inside their brain,
这些经验在大脑中形成沟槽

1037
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:03,140
so when someone said "Oxford Circus",immediately they knew
当有人说"牛津广场"时 他们立即知道

1038
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:06,190
what street they need to take to Oxford Circus.
要走哪条街才能去到牛津广场

1039
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,420
Their brain actually became bigger.
他们的大脑变得更大

1040
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:13,220
It changed their neuroplasiticity. And that's wonderful news.
那改变了他们的神经可塑性 那是个好消息

1041
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,690
It's really wonderful news. Because it means we have control.
是非常好的消息 那意味着我们可以控制

1042
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,020
And we can introduce change.
我们可以引入改变

1043
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:24,050
Now in our brain,there are both healthy and unhealthy pathways.
在大脑中既有健康通道也有不健康的

1044
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,860
So for example,
比如说

1045
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:30,650
some of the negative channels may be one of the constant worrier-
一些消极的通道 一个总是忧心重重的人

1046
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:34,280
someone who worries a lot. That every time something happens,
一个事事担心的人 只要有事发生

1047
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,420
immediately they gravitate to
他们立即转向

1048
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,990
"ok so what does that mean for the future?"
"那对未来意味着什么?"

1049
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,690
Or "what does that mean now for my prospects?"
"那对我的期望意味着什么?"

1050
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:46,540
"What does it mean for today?" Constantly worrying about things.
"那对今天意味着什么?" 时刻担心各种事情

1051
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:48,250
Even good things very often.
甚至经常为好事担心

1052
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,960
They immediately interpret it as something to be worry about.
他们会立即把好事理解成需要担心的事

1053
01:04:52,700 --> 01:05:00,550
Or fault finding. That's pathways in the brain where I look for-
或者发现缺陷 消极思维会通过那条大脑通道

1054
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,850
again they are self-reinforcing-
再说一次 通道是自行巩固的

1055
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:05,010
I begin to look for in my world things that go wrong.
我会通过那条通道不断寻找我的缺陷

1056
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,420
Remember my personal experience
我还记得自己的亲身经历

1057
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,430
where I got the fellowship as a senior here.
当我获得本校的奖学金时

1058
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,890
And I got the fellowship and immediately my brain gravitated
我得到了奖学金 但我的大脑立即开始想

1059
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,630
toward "Ok but why didn't I get the other one?"
"但我为什么没得到另一个?"

1060
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,430
I had so many things to be grateful for.
我有那么多事情值得感激

1061
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,610
But it's the fault finder immediately the neural pathway,
但作为消极者 神经通道

1062
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:27,860
the river this experience fell into was the largest one.
经验流向的河流是条最大的河

1063
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:32,570
And the largest one for me at that time was being a fault finder.
当时对我来说 最宽的河流就是消极的

1064
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,860
Then there are positive channels as well.
也有积极的渠道

1065
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:41,280
What are the positive channels? Benefit finder. A person
积极的渠道是什么? 积极者

1066
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,470
who is able to find benefit even in the hard circumstances.
一个即使在困难环境也能发现恩惠的人

1067
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,190
May not say that the things happen for the best,
也许不会说塞翁失马 焉知非福

1068
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,040
but something,but people made the best of things happen.
但他会从发生的事情中寻找恩惠

1069
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,440
The optimist.
乐观主义者

1070
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,910
Again,much larger,much wider channels for optimism.
乐观主义的渠道更大更宽

1071
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:00,020
And the experiences gravitate toward there.
经验流向那里

1072
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:06,280
Today we know much more how the brain works.
今天我们对大脑的认识更多

1073
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,320
And where these channels exist?
这些渠道存在在哪里?

1074
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,000
so let me give you an example of the one of the things we know.
我给大家举个众所周知的例子

1075
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,400
One of the things that we know is that people
我们都知道

1076
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:21,170
who have more action on the left side of the prefrontal cortex,
经常使用左侧前额皮质的人

1077
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,610
compared to the right side of the prefrontal cortex,
和经常使用右侧前额皮质的人相比

1078
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,750
are general happier. More susceptible to positive emotions,
要更快乐 更易受积极情绪的影响

1079
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,300
more resilient in phase of painful emotions.
对痛苦情绪的适应性更强

1080
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:34,010
More activation here- prefrontal cortex,
前额皮质这部分的活动更多

1081
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,800
compared to the right side of the prefrontal cortex.
与右侧前额皮质相比

1082
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,310
People who have more activation on the right side compard to
右侧活动更多的人

1083
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:45,550
the left of f the prefrontal cortex are generally more depressed.
和左侧活动更多的人相比要更压抑

1084
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,880
Now we know that today because we have FMRI,
今天我们知道这些 是因为有功能性磁共振成像

1085
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,530
because we have EEG.
因为我们有脑电图

1086
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,350
We can see how much the brain works on each side.
能看到大脑两侧的运作

1087
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:57,580
But we knew that already hundreds of years ago.
但几百年前 我们已经知道这一点了

1088
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:01,120
We knew that this side is associated with positive emotions,
我们知道这边与积极情绪有关

1089
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,140
and more activation on this side of the front,
前额皮质这侧的活动越多

1090
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,830
is associated with painful emotions.
与痛苦情绪相关联

1091
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,990
How? Because when people,for example were in an accident,
怎么知道的? 因为人们发生意外时

1092
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,480
and the accident happened to them
意外发生在他们身上

1093
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:15,000
and the left side of the prefrontal cortex was damaged,
左侧前额皮质受损时

1094
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,020
very often they became more depressed.
他们经常变得更抑郁

1095
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,230
Because they had more activation on the right side as a result.
因为右侧的活动更多

1096
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:21,690
In comparison,
相比而言

1097
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,050
people who had an accident on the right side on the other hand,
另一方面如果意外发生在右侧

1098
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:31,520
on the right side,very often,became happier.
右侧受损 人们经常会变得更快乐

1099
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,870
Now I don't recommen this as an intervention.
我不建议以此为干预方法

1100
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,460
Don't try it at home without your parents or with your parents.
不管有没有父母在家 都不要在家尝试

1101
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,970
However,if you walk in the street,and you happen to fall,
但是如果走在街上 碰巧摔倒

1102
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:46,840
it's always better to fall this way. So just keep that in mind.
最好往这边摔 大家记往了

1103
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,980
Important thing to keep in mind then is that
需要记住的更重要的事是

1104
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:03,360
very often the same trigger causes very different reactions.
相同的刺激往往造成不同的反应

1105
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,690
Again the world is not just the external world.
世界不只是外在世界

1106
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:07,270
It's also the internal world.
还有一个内在世界

1107
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,840
Remember to the same mind,as Emerson said,
记往对同一个头脑来说 正如爱默生所说

1108
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,260
the same world can be... or to the different minds,
同样的世界...对不同的头脑来说

1109
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,190
the same world can be a heaven or a hell.
同样的世界即可能是天堂也可能是地狱

1110
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:20,180
Depends on what that experience gravitates toward.
要看那种经验流向哪里

1111
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,710
Over the years,I've become a  much more,
多年来 我变得

1112
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:27,120
much more of a benefit finder through the exercise,
更像一个积极者 通过修习

1113
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:32,060
through thinking about it,by writting,keeping a journal,
通过沉思 通过书写 写日记

1114
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,600
by physically exercising,I become much more of a benefit finder.
通过身体锻炼 我变成了积极者

1115
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,290
I've done a lot of work in that.
为此我付出很多努力

1116
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:42,270
One of the great fortunes in my life is that
我人生最大的财富

1117
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:45,770
I married a consummate benefit finder.
是我娶了一个完美的积极者

1118
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,790
Tommy,my wife doesn't have to work that hard at it.
我的妻子Tommy 她不需要后天的努力

1119
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,850
So for example,we would come back from a party.
举个例子 我们参加一次派对回来

1120
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,070
And there was someone at the party who couldn't stop talking.
派对上有个人一个劲地说话

1121
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:02,240
Have you encountered a person... Well,couldn't stop talking.
你们遇到过吗...一个说个不停的人

1122
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,940
And I just about to tell Tommy you know,
我正要和Tommy抱怨

1123
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,480
this person just couldn't shut his or her mouth.
说个人就是个话痨

1124
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:10,220
And what would she say before I open my mouth? She said,
她在我开口前说了什么? 她说

1125
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,400
"see how wonderful that person was
"你看那个人多好

1126
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:16,350
and he or she is so passionate about what they do?"
他对所做的事是如此热情?"

1127
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,690
So for me,it was talkative. For her,it was passion.
在我眼中多话 在她眼中是热情

1128
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,490
Again,automatically going there.
她自动地发现恩惠

1129
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,200
There is a genetic set point- and we'll talk about the genes-
这里有基因因素 我们会谈到基因

1130
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:29,830
that lead some people to be much more benefit finders than others
让某些人比其他人更善于发现益处

1131
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:31,930
But at the same time,we can work on it.
但与此同时 我们可以加以培养

1132
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:35,990
We can work on it,pathway by pathway. And
我们可以一条通道一条通道地塑造

1133
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,460
what we are doing there is quite literally transforming the brain
我们所做的就是改变大脑

1134
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,500
We'll talk about during the week on mindfulness meditation
我们会在讲到"念"和"冥想"时讲这个问题

1135
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,220
that meditation- for instance regular yoga- actually makes our..
冥想 比如经常做瑜珈

1136
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,930
changes the pathwaya in our brain,
能改变我们大脑里的通道

1137
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:54,400
makes it more active on the left side compared to the right side.
让左侧相比右侧更活跃

1138

Think about how to learn to play musical instrument.

It takes time. It's by the way the same process,

1152
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:52,690
because we are creating new neural pathways in our brain,

So the change process in and of itself can also be fun.
