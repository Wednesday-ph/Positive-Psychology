it is much more similar than different

if we need constantly the accolades of that group

You know, to prove how good I am

544
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,200
I have to compare myself to another
我必须拿自己跟别人比较

545
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,700
whether I choose you know, place of residence

546
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800

547
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,500
whether I choose the color of the skin

548
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,000
It's about relative competence
它的中心是相对能力感

549
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,300

555
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,400
This is not always good
原则并不总是好的

556
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,300
because I'm sure there are also Nazis
因为纳粹分子

557
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,000
who are true to their principles
也很坚持自己的原则

558
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,500
But as I'll show later in research

I mean that in a true sense of the word, damaged

Their levels of empathy will increase
他们的移情会增加

566
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,100
And this is the paradox of empathy
这是移情的矛盾

567
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,500
It's actually when we cultivate empathy
当我培养移情时

568
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,000
or rather when we cultivate
或者说当我们培养…

569

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,300

love your neighbors as you love yourself
要像爱自己一样爱你的邻居

577
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,100

578
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,300
what is the prerequisite of loving your neighbor?

579
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
The self
爱自己

580
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,600
You are the standard
你就是标准

581
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,000
we are the standard of how we evaluate others
我们自己是我们评价他人的标准

582
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,500
because our behavior toward others very often
因为我们怎么对待他们经常…

583
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,200
not always
不是通常

584
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,900
very often - mirrors our behavior toward ourselves
但经常都反映了我们怎么对待自己

585
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,700
So people cultivating independent sense of self
所以那些培养独立自我感的人

586
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:16,700
who have a strong self identity are better able to identify with others
那些有强烈自我认同的人 更能认同别人

587
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,800
In addition to moral behavior
除了道德行为以外

588
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,700
better cognitive performance - you see
还会有更好的认知表现

589
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,900
people who have a strong dependent self-esteem
有强烈依赖型自尊的人

590
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,300
or are primarily driven by what other people say
或者说行动主要由他人言论决定的人

591
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,300
will follow the rule that has already been taken
会遵循别人在遵循的规矩

592
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,400
They will, can potentially be great mechanics
他们很可能变得就像一台机器一样

593
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,300
because they'll work hard for these accolade
因为他们会为了得到赞扬而努力

594
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,400
and that's a good thing, to work hard
努力是好事

595
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,200
But they'll basically remain within the box
但他们不会打破陈规

596
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,400
whereas the people who have a stronger sense of independent self-esteem
而有强烈独立型自尊的人

597
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,700
think outside the box
就会打破陈规

598
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,200
choose the path that hasn't already been taken
选择别人没有走过的道路

599
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
That doesn't mean that they can't walk in the pat
但这并不代表他们不会选择

600
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,900
that has been taken
别人已经走过的路

601
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
if that is what they really
只是这是他们真正

602
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,200
really want to do with their lives
真正想要的生活就行了

603
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,800
So you know it's just as much sign of dependence when we say
所以如果我们说"别人说走东 我偏偏走西"

604
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,500
"Wel,I am gonna do the opposite of what everyone else does."
这同样也是依赖型的

605
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,700
because I'm still dependent on what everyone else does
因为我的行为还是取决于他人

606
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,600
So that's not independent self-esteem
所以这不是独立型自尊

607
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,300
That's just more dependence
而是依赖型自尊

608

were actually more generous and benevolent

both in terms of self report and in terms of their actual behavior

761
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,400
toward other people - a strong sense of self

762
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Remember, love your neighbor as you love yourself

Do not do unto others which you would not have done to yourself

And when you have a high standard for the self

767
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,900
because we mirror our behavior toward the "I"
因为我们怎么对待他人就会怎么对待自己

768
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,100
And then hostility
还有敌对情绪

769
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,000
no correlation between hostility and self-esteem per se
敌对情绪与自尊本身没有关系

770
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,700
because some people have

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,300
with high self-esteem, have high levels of hostility

772
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,000
some people with high self-esteem have low levels of hostility

773
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,300
and more generosity
而且更宽厚仁慈

774
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,000
But dependent and independent self-esteem predicted hostility

Those with high self-esteem that was mostly dependent

776
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,700
were more likely, not always, not every person

but on average, were more likely to display hostility

784
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,300
and self-esteem - how people with high independent self-esteem

785
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,500
were less likely to be perfectionistic
他们是完美主义者的可能性更低

786
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,400
Why? Because it is about self expression

787
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,200
it's about constantly learning and growing

788
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000

而学习和成长

789

no other way to learn
学习只有这个途径

791
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,100
Whereas dependent self-esteem were more concerned

792
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,400
the words of Mihnea Moldoveanu that I quoted last time

794
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,600

more perfectionistic, more afraid of failure

797
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,600
So this applies also - and we talked about before

798
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,700
but I just want to point it out again - to relationships

799
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,800
That's work on the topic

David Schnarch again where we talked about
就这个课题所做的研究 我们说过

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,600
how do we get to the stage of being known
我们怎么达到被了解的阶段

802
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,900
rather than being validated
而不是被认可的阶段

803
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,700
And that doesn't mean that at the age of 70 or 80
这并不代表在七八十岁时

804
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,900
when we are fully evolved

805
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,100
we don't enjoy or need at times the validation of our partner

We do

we are much more about self expression
我们更关心的是表达自我

809
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,700
Here is what David Schnarch has to say
David Schnarch是这样说的

810
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,000
"Differentiation is your ability to maintain your sense of self

811

and family pressure you to agree and conform

817
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,000
Well-differentiated people can agree without feeling

818

like they're 'losing themselvs'

819
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,000
and can disagree without feeling alienated and embittered."
能够不同意 但又不会觉得被排挤和难受"

820
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
This is what being known is all about
这正是被了解的含义

821
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,200
being yourself, being differentiated
做你自己 分化出来

822
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,500
This is what independent self-esteem is
这就是独立型自尊的核心

823
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,400
this is what ultimately interdependence

is all about

easier said than done
说来容易做来难

826
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,400
But again it's very helpful to have that as a heuristic
但用它来启发我们是非常有用的

827
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,700
the back of your mind

828
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,400

we don't evolve as we can

847
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,500
So the question is also on the psychological level

We've discussed most

903
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:27,700
First, people with high independent self-esteem generally

904
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,100
as we saw before from the research

00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,700
And if I'm constantly about chasing honor
如果我不停地追逐荣誉

1059
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,000
the next accolade, the next prize
追逐下一个赞扬 下一个奖

1060
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,700
the next approval, the next validation
下一个认同 下一个认可

1061
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,400
then honor will run away from me
荣誉就会躲避我

1062
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,300
And then I'll have to push that stone up steeper
下一次我就要在更陡的山坡上

1063
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,900
incline the next time
把石头推上去

1064
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,600
And I continue to chase that honor and I get there
我继续追逐荣誉 等我到达了山顶

1065
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,200
and then the rock rolls back down again
石头又会滚下来

1066
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,700
And Sisyphus continues on and on with the steep becoming...

1067
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,200
with the incline becoming steeper
越来越陡峭

1068
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,200
Whereas if I run away from honor - behave humbly

1069
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,800
over time honor, true honor

1070
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,800
internally generated honor will chase me
打心底发出的荣誉感就会追逐我

1071
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,200
Behavior can change attitude
行为可以改变态度

1072
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,900
It takes time
这需要时间

1073
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,800
And again at the beginning
重申 一开始

1074
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,800
as I mentioned to you before
正如我之前说过

1075
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,700
I wanted to be modest and I wanted everyone to know
我想变得谦虚 我想大家都知道

1076
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,400
how modest I was and how humble I was

1077
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,600
And I understood that well
我明白

1078
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,300
that's not genuine
那不是真诚的谦虚

1079
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,500
but I can still behave and act in a humble way
但我仍然可以保持谦虚的言行

1080
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,100
And over time
随着时间过去

1081
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,500
it becomes more and more part of who we are
它就会慢慢地融入我们

1082
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:54,200
Behavior changing attitude doesn't happen overnight
行为不会一夜之间就改变态度

1083
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,100
And again it doesn't mean that a person at 80
但这并不意味着一个80岁

1084
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:01,000
who is evolved and actualized does not look for honor at all
完成进化 实现自我的人 不会追寻荣誉

1085
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,200
does not feel good when he or she is praised
当他们被赞扬时 不会觉得高兴

1086
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,600
That's natural - part of who we are
那是很自然的 是人的天性

1087
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,700
This is an important one
以下这个知识点很重要

1088
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,700
We've talked about it a lot in the class about simplifying
我们在班上经常讲简化生活

1089
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:20,100
The...
那…

1090
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,500
I've often wondered the why is it that in a county
我经常想 为什么在一个

1091
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,800
like the United States
像美国这样的国家里

1092
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,300
such an individualistic country - self-reliance
一个追崇个人主义 自为更生的国家

1093
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,200
most of you read it in high school by Emerson
大家在高中时读了爱默生

1094
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,300
so much about individualism and the self
那么多关于个人主义和自我的书

1095
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,400
why is it that there's such high levels of conformity?
为什么你们还是那么随波逐流?

1096
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,100
Why is it that so many people go on the path
为什么有那么多人还是走

1097
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,200
that has been already taken and prescribed by others?
以前很多人已经走过的路?

1098
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,200
That doesn't mean that everyone who goes on the path conforms
这并不意味着走这条路的人都是随波逐流的

1099
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,500
Again, you can be highly conforming
再一次 你可能很循规蹈矩

1100
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:03,000
choosing to work as a consultant or choosing to be a volunteer
选择做一个顾问或者在流浪者之家

1101

1102
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,600
You can be equally other determined or equally self determined
你可能是取决于他人的 也可能是取决于自我的

1103
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,700
It's not about choosing a particular path
重点不在于选哪条路

1104
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,700
But why did I
重点是为什么

1105
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,000
why do we see so many people who conform?
我们会看到这么多随波逐流的人?

1106
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,500
And I think it's because of their right raise
我想这是因为他们的成长教育

1107
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,600
I think it's because people in the United States
我想是因为美国人

1108
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,700
Western world in general
或者普遍来说 西方世界

1109
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,500
do not take enough time to reflect

1110
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,000
and to think about those questions such as
思考这样的问题:

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
"what do I reall, really want to do with my life?

1112
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,900
to ask questions such as

"what would I do in a world where no one would know

1114
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,800
what I was doing?"

1115
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,400
to go through the three question process - the meaning
用三问法来问自己 意义

1116
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,500
"what is meaningful?"; "what is pleasurable?"

1117

those important questions

1121
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,200
because when we take a step back and take the time
因为当我们退后一步 慢慢思考

1122
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,500
that's when we become ourselve
这时我们才能变成自我

1123
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:03,800
that's when we identify the path that is right for me
我们才能找到适合我们的道路

1124
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,200
Let me illustrate this by showing you a stage model
我想用一个阶段模型来给大家讲解

1125
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,700
And this is based on the work of Daniel Gilbert
这是以Daniel Gilbert的研究为基础的

1126
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:18,900
indirectly refers to it his work on cognitive dizziness
与他的认知晕眩研究有间接关系

1127
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,800
And what he and others have shown is that

1128
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,200
people behave very differently when they are cognitively busy

1129
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,900
when they are in a hurry
他们的行为会非常不同于

1130
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,400
versus when they have time
当他们慢慢花时间

1131
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,200
they can focus on whatever it is that they are doing
专心思考一下他们所做的事时

1132
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,300
So also connected to Tim Kasser's work on time affluence
也跟Tim Kasser的时间充裕研究有关

1133
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,200
So the first stage is the stage where we don't have time
第一个段阶是我们没有时间的阶段

1134
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,800
we are in a hurry; we are rushed

1135
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,600
our reaction is automatic

1136
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,400
This is the part where we conform

This is time when we conform to the group

as in the Asch experiments

telling us the experiment must go on

1141
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,900
And we push the button and shock an innocent victim

1142
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,700
This is where conformity to obedience

when we don't really think about

01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,800
what it is that we want to do and can do
我们想做什么 可以做什么时

1148
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,800
This is our dependent self - stage one

1149
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,700
We very often at this moment can reach stage two

1150
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,400
don't need to wait a long time

That's where we are much less likely to conform

1169
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,300
Imagine this - some of you know the Milgram experiment
