1
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,290
Hi,good morning! So today's lecture is about change.
早上好 今天要讲的是变化

2
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,980
And things are going to change today.
今天很多事都会发生变化

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,970
Our relationship is going to change today.So stay tuned.
我们之间的关系会发生变化 敬请关注啊

4
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,570
Last time,
上节课

5
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,360
last time we ended by talking about the different kinds of change
上节课结束的时候 我们谈到很多种不同变化

6
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,150
The first approach―the gradual approach,
第一种方式 是渐进式的

7
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,560
like water wearing down stone,
好像滴水穿石

8
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,250
chipping away gradually slowly taking our time.
要花时间的一点一点 慢慢的

9
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,080
The second approach―the acute change,
第二种方式 是突发式的

10
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,630
the sledge hammer breaking stone creating a new pathway,
好像用大锤开山劈石

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,720
a new channel.
凿出一条路 一个隧道

12
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,330
The important thing to keep in mind with both forms of changes,
对于这两种变化 或是所有形式的变化

13
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,540
with all form of change,
必须要注意的是

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,500
lasting change that is,which is what we are about.
我们讲的重点是要将变化持续下去

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,040
Not just the spike and the return to base level.
而不是突然一变之后又恢复原状

16
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,820
The thing to keep in mind about change
因此要注意的是

17
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,070
is that neither is quick-fix.
变化既不是药到病除的灵丹妙药

18
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,460
Even when we pick up that sledge hammer,
即便当我们举起大锤

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,620
even when we pick it up,
就是这举起来的动作

20
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,750
we need to do a lot of work before the preparation.
也需要我们在之前做很多准备的功夫

21
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,530
So for example,gradual change,
因此 举例来说 渐进式的变化

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,140
slow change would be doing the gratitude exercise everyday,
包括每天都做感恩练习

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,180
slowly becoming more and more of a benefit finder,
慢慢成为一个更容易找寻美好的人

24
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,210
gradually looking more at the positive,
逐渐的看到更多积极的事物

25
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,280
creating a new neural pathway neuron by neuron.
一点一点的构建起新的神经通路

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,340
Remember neuroplasticity and neurogenesis―
还记得我们之前说过的两个重要概念

27
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,730
two very important concepts
神经塑性和新生神经元吗?

28
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,320
because just by knowing by understanding that our brain changes
因为通过了解和理解我们大脑的变化

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,040
that in and of itself makes us more likely to change.
我们自身也将更容易产生变化

30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,400
And this is work done by Carol Dweck,
Carol Dweck做过相关研究

31
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,360
whom I'll discuss in future courses when we discuss perfectionism
我们之后谈到完美主义的时候还会提到她

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,610
And then the sledge hammer example is like the Eureka experience,
另外大锤的例子和探索经验是一回事

33
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,730
the great insight that doesn't come in a vacuum.
真知灼见不是凭空产生的 而是经过

34
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,220
It comes after a lot of hard work after a lot of preparation.
长时间准备后千锤百炼而得来的

35
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,860
You know the 99% of perspiration that leads to that inspiration.
大家都知道所谓的灵感来自于99%的汗水

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,400
So no quick-fix.And the believe in quick-fix,
所以说 没有灵丹妙药 而且

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,700
the expectation of the quick-fix that is one of the reasons
正是那种对灵丹妙药的笃信和渴求

38
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,070
why levels of the depression are so high today,
导致了今天抑郁症如此高发频发

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,580
because people are frustrated.They are disappointed.
因为大家都很郁闷 很失望

40
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,750
They think there's something wrong with them
发现灵丹妙药不管用的时候

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
when they don't succeed in the quick-fix.
就觉得是自己出了问题

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,500
But they have just,I just write in the book that it's possible.
我在书里也写了 很可能他们认为

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,230
If I do these five things,I'd be happy for the rest of my life.
"如果做完这五件事 我的人生就会美满了"

44
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,320
And I do these five things.And I'm not happier.
结果五件事做完 我却没有变得更快乐

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,480
And I begin to question myself.
于是我就开始怀疑自己

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,570
No quick-fix.It takes time.
没有灵丹妙药 任何事都需要时间

47
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,220
No five easy steps to happiness.
没有所谓什么"幸福生活五步走"

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,370
Before we go to the change process,
在我们讲变化过程之前

49
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,800
there are a few things we need to understand.
我们先要理清一些概念

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,970
The first thing to understand is this.
首先我们要问的是

51
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,560
Do I,do you really want to change?
我 或者你 真的想要改变吗?

52
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,800
Do I really want to improve certain things in my personality…
我是不是真的想要改善我的个性

53
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,710
things that… or character,or behavior,things that I don't like.
或者我不喜欢的性格或行为 

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,330
And it's not a trivial question.
这不是一个无关紧要的问题

55
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,360
It is not a rhetorical question
也不是象征性地问自己一下

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,020
because very often on the conscious level we maybe saying yes,
因为表面上我们可能会说当然了

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,370
but on the subconscious level something is stopping us.
但是潜意识里却有东西在阻挠我们

58
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,990
Let me show you an example.
我给大家举个例子吧

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,370
So this is the study done by Langer and,
早在80年代的时候 Langer

60
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,510
and Thompson back in the 80s.
和Thompson曾做过一个实验

61
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,470
And here is what they did.
这个实验是这样的

62
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,430
They brought students in or participants in.
他们找来一些学生或参与实验的人

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,200
And they asked them

64
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,500
whether they wanted to get rid of certain characteristics,
他们想不想要摆脱自己性格的某个方面

65
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,990
like rigidity,or being gullible,or grimness.
比如说古板 或者容易轻信别人

66
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,010
And they asked them
或是冷酷 他们问这些人

67
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,630
whether they wanted to get rid of these characteristics
想不想要摆脱这些性格

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,300
and whether they succeeded in becoming better in this area.
想不想在这方面变的更好

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,690
Were you able to introduce change,
是不是真的能改变自己 即是说

70
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,220
so were you able to actually become less rigid,
如果改变对于你来说真的很重要

71
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,320
if this was important for you to change,
那你能不能最终变得不那么古板

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,970
or less gullible,or less grim?
不那么容易轻信别人 不那么冷酷

73
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,660
So this is the first two questions that they asked.
这就是他们最初问的两个问题

74
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,210
Did you want to improve it? Did you wanna change this?

75
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,110
The second question C were you successful?
第二个问题 能不能改变

76
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,520
And then after they answered these questions,
然后 在他们问了这些问题之后

77
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,470
there was the second part of the study
实验还有第二个阶段 在这个阶段

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,810
where they asked them to evaluate the positive,

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,850
Is it important to you to be trustworthy?
值得信赖 是不是重要

82
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,240
And how important it is for you
以及 被认为是一个严肃认真的人

83
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,550
to be and to be perceived as a serious person?
对于你来说有多重要

84
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,460
And here is the interesting finding of this research.
下面我们来说这个实验的有趣的结果

85
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,870
Those individuals who rated the positive traits,
所有给这些正面性格打高分的人

86
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,170
the ones in yellow,who rated them high,

89
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,430
Do you understand implications of the study?
大家明白这其中的奥妙么?

90
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,950
So what is saying is that…
也就是说 比如 

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,110
Let's say I do wanna get rid of rigidity.
我想要摆脱古板的个性

92

consistency is a very important value to me.

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,620
I'm less likely to change my rigidity

96
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,680
because they are associated in my mind.
因为在我的意识里 它们是相互关联的

97
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,260
And yeah,I don't want to be rigid.

I want to be consistent.
我想要言行一致

I associate them together.

And to me they are linked.

105
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,210
The same with gullibility and trustworthiness.
同理 还有轻信和值得信赖

106
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:36,800
We can say that
这两种品质 可以说 值得信赖的人

the other side of gullibility someone who's trustworthy.

However I don't get rid of my gullibility

Same with grim.I may be grim

112
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,960
but that's also subconsciously a sign of my seriousness.
可能在潜意识里正反映出我的严肃认真

113
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,470
You know for years,literally years,

when I've been thinking and writing

and analyzing the notion of perfectionism,

I read the research,I look through personal experiences.

我知道完美主义对我百害无益 有损于我的健康

121
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,040
but also in the long term in terms of my success.And
从长远来看 也阻挠我成功

122
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,580
yet I couldn't get rid of perfectionism until I read the study.
但是我却摆脱不了它 直到我读了这个报告

123
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,620
And I asked myself,

124
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,110
‘OK,so what is the counterpart to perfectionism?

129
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,870
that I would define myself as I'm driven and I'm ambitious.
定义就是我有动力和雄心抱负

And because I didn't want to lose these characteristics,

132
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,880
stopped me from getting rid of the perfectionism,
摆脱对完美主义的追求

133
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,920

134
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,100
failure that prevents us…

So we'll get more in depth if you'll understand what it means.

And it was only once I understood

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,170
I was able to unpack them,to distinguish them.

I said I want to keep one not the other.

Look I've mentioned these many times before,

next time I'll talk to you about the process

Part of me since the time I can't remember myself.
自从很久以前开始

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,720
We want to focus on the three.
我们要对三元素同时下功夫

289
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,190
The A,the B and the C.
A B和C三元素

290
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,920
It's ..Think about it.
大家可以想想看

291
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,430
It's like a habit can be looked as a flood.
就好象 我们把习惯看成一股洪流

292
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,120
There's flood in our mind
一股我们思维的洪流 这股洪流是

293
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,600
of certain neurons firing in certain neuron pathway.
由来自不同通路的神经元构成的

294
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,390
And what we want to do is to overcome this flood.
我们现在要做的是对抗这股洪流

295
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,850
And to overcome this flood we need as much force as we can,
为了做到这点 我们需要足够大的外力

296
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,930
therefore we want to use as many approaches as we can.
因此我们要尝试尽可能多的方法

297
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,650
Before we jump into the A,
在我们讲A元素之前

298
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,420
one more thing -- what do we want to change?
我再问一个问题 我们想改变什么?

299
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,330
What can we change? And what can we not change?
我们能改变什么?不能改变什么?

300
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,940
So according to researchers led by the lights of
以Lyubomirsky Diener等人为首的

301
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,050
Sonja Lyubomirsky,Ed Diener,happiness comprises…
研究者宣称 快乐是由三部分构成的

302
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,990
as we're to explain an individual's happiness,
在我们试图分析一个人的幸福感时

303
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,540
we need to look at the three factors.
我们需要研究三个因素

304
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,010
The first factor is the genetic set range,
第一个因素是遗传排列

305
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,960
not genetic set point,it's a range.
不是遗传点 而是排列

306
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,020
We're all born with
我们都生来具备一些

307
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,140
certain predisposition toward happiness and well-being.
特定的快乐和健康倾向性体质

308
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,980
Some people are born more with..
有些人生来就是

309
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,970
you know the smiley face with the smiley spoon in their mouth;
一张笑脸 嘴里含着"笑汤匙"

310
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,900
others less so.
另一些人则不然

311
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,550
And we're all somewhere on this,
我们都排列在这条钟形曲线上

312
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,410
you know bell curve,some people luckier than others.
有些人注定比其他人更幸运

313
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,910
As I mentioned couple of times before,I wasn't born that lucky.
我之前也提过几次 我就没那么走运

314
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,300
I was born more on the anxious side of this curve not with the,
我一出生就在曲线上偏焦虑的那一端

315
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,610
with the happy spoon in my mouth,
嘴里也没含着快乐的小汤匙

316
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,360
which by the way I think helps me teach this class,
但我的天性令我有资格教这门课

317
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,220
because I do these things,I apply these things,
因为我通过努力和各种尝试

318
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,800
I make a difference in my life.
改变了自己的人生

319
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,980
You know,been there,done that,doing it.
我可以谈个人的经验

320
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,930
I can speak from personal experiences as you know.
因为我有过那样的经历

321
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,830
Now some people may look at it and say,
现在有些人可能会说

322
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,570
‘that's terrible that we have a genetic set range.'
"我们还有遗传排列 真是太可怕了"

323
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,640
Well,my answer to that is,it's not terri..
对此 我想说 这不是什么好事

324
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,680
it's not good.It's not bad.It is.
也不是坏事 这只是既定事实

325
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,250
The law of gravity.It's not good it's not bad.It is.
就好象万有引力 无所谓好坏

326
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,440
And nature to be commanded must be obeyed.
想要支配天性 必先服从天性

327
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,610
We need to look at our nature,
我们要认识自己的天性

328
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,910
understand it and then make the best of it.
理解 并充分善用这些天性

329
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,340
About 50 percent of our levels of well-being of the variance
我们健康中和快乐相关的指数差异

330
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,420
in explaining happiness can't be accounted for by genes,
有50%并不是由遗传所决定的

331
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
which explains some of the results,
当然遗传基因是有影响的

332
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,580
or for example,the twin studies.
比如 双胞胎研究的案例

333
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,770
Why there were such similarities among the twins
为什么有很多对双胞胎

334
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,950
even if they were,or between the twins,
在长期分离的情况下

335
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,000
even if they were real depart.
彼此之间仍有那么多相似之处

336
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,380
Because genes matter.Not good,not bad.It is.
因为遗传决定的 这作用无所谓好坏

337
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,870
They matter 50 percent,not 100 percent,thank God,
也不是百分百由它决定 感谢上帝

338
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,390
but 50 percent of the variance.
只有差异中的50%

339
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,010
The important thing to keep in mind is that
我们应该随时牢记 对于如何运用

340
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,560
we have a lot of control what we do with these genes.
这些基因 我们是有很多的支配能力的

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,100
You know one could argue that success...
你可以说成功是...我只是随便举例

342
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,700
and I'm just throwing out numbers.I don't know what it is exactly.
我并不知道确切的数据

343
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,270
But successful basketball players

344
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,190
is determined 50 percent by genes in terms of how much fast
50%是由遗传基因决定的 比如

345
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,030
twitch versus slow twitch they have in their muscles,
肌肉里有多少快肌纤维和慢肌纤维

346
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,860
or how high they can jump,how coordinated they are,
或者 能跳多高 协调性如何

347
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,470
how tall they are.All these things matter.
身高多少 这些都很重要

348
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,470
They go into the… And these are determined by genes.
这些都是由基因决定的

349
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,320
However,if Michael Jordan hadn't worked on his basketball,

350
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,550
I would be a better player than he is.
我应该能比他打的好

351
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,760
If he didn't work on his basketball at all,and I did and do.
如果他从没练过的话 而且我的确练过

352
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,370
In other words also with genes,
换句话说 在遗传作用的前提下

353
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,120
people who don't work on their happiness
不去努力争取幸福的人

354
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,550
even if they have the best of genes will not do
即便他们有最好的遗传基因 也不会比

355
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,930
as well as people with less happy genes who work on it.
基因不如他们但努力争取的人快乐

356
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,380
So work matters a great deal.
所以说 后天努力至关重要

357
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,160
The second thing that matters that
第二个对快乐差异指数

358
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,480
makes up the hundred percent of variance of happiness,
有影响的因素

359
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,660
external circumstances.
是外部环境

360
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,650
Of course,extreme circumstances make a lot of difference,
当然了 外部环境很重要

361
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,330
whether we're living in a free country versus oppression.
我们生活在一个自由的国度

362
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,310
That makes a lot of difference.
还是受人压迫 带来的结果是完全不同的

363
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,460
However,in general,external circumstances beyond the extremes,
但总的来说 外部环境只要不过于极端

364
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,180
beyond being homeless on the street,make very little difference,
比如无家可归流浪街头 其实影响不大

365
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:24,900
in fact,about 10% of the total variance.So genetic genes 50%,
在差异方面只有10%的作用 因此

366
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,260
external circumstances such as place of residence,
遗传作用50% 外部环境包括居住地

367
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,640
such as income,such as weather.
包括收入 天气等等

368
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,620
And again not for people,for example,
另外这个不包括

369
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,280
who have seasonal affective disorder.
有季节性情感异常的患者

370
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,100
Then of course it matters whether we get sun or not.
对于他们来说 有没有阳光太重要了

371
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,540
I'm talking about,um,most people,not people with SAD.
我现在说的是大部分人 不包括有

372
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,360
So out of these extremes,external circumstances make,
季节性情感异常的人 因此除去极端案例

373
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,300
matter about 10%,not much.
外部环境的作用不大 大概是10%

374
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,700
The third thing,
第三点

375
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,570
the rest of the 40% is accounted for by intentional activities.
剩下的40%是由意向活动决定

376
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,650
What that means is what we do,how we act,what we think about,
意向活动包括我们的所作所为所想

377
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,570
how we interpret the world,what we focus on.

379
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,050
What we have discussed since the first class,

380
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,190
what we're gonna discuss even more in the second half of the semester.
以及下半学期我们将要讨论的内容

381
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
These intentional activities,
这些意向活动 我们关注的焦点

382
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,380
our focus,these are essentially our ABCs.
其实就是我们的ABC

383
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,850
This is what real meaningful change comes.
这也是产生有意义的变化的根源

384
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,400
And this is where we are gonna focus.
是我们将要关注的重点

385
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,710
Would be nice if we could do something with our genes.
如果我们能改变遗传基因 当然很好

386
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,220
Would be nice.Cannot.Would be nice
是很好 但是不可能

387
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,810
if we had more control of our external circumstances.
如果我们能更好的控制外部环境

388
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,700
But even if we did and many people do.
当然很好 但是即便是我们能控制

389
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,890
Many people sitting in this room or watching at home,
结果也不会被改变 虽然在场的

390
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,740
do have more control doesn't make that much of the difference.
或是在家看视频的人中 有很多的确

391
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,750
What makes the most difference
能更好的控制外部环境

392
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,770
that we have control over are the internal activities,
能改变结果的 能被我们所掌控的

393
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,360
our interpretation of the world and our action.
是内部活动 是我们对世界的诠释

394
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,110
So let's jump into it.
和我们的行动 好 现在我们就开始讲

395
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:04,570
The A,affect,emotion,the heart, it's a connection between,
这部分的内容 A 情感 情绪 是一种连接

396
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,010
and it's a more logical connection,
更多的是从逻辑上 语言上

397
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,910
linguistic connection between emotion,motivation,motion.
将情感 动力 动作连接起来

398
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,280
E-motion to move away.Without emotion we wouldn't move.
情感 感动 移动 没有情感

399
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,650
You read about it in the book.
我们将寸步难行 你们在书中读到了

400
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,110
Or you will read about it in the book about Elliott,
或者之后会读到 关于Elliott的故事

401
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,760
the person who Damásio research
Damásio做了关于他研究

402
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,000
who just lost his emotional faculty

403
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,250
and with it lost all motivation to act or do anything
并随之丧失了行动做事的所有动力

404
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,880
even though his cognition was in place.
尽管他还有认知能力

405
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,770
We need emotion in order to move.
我们要行动就必须要情感

406
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,170
So I wanna talk about,again,two aspects within emotion.
现在我要从两个方面谈情感

407
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,100
The first,gradual change.The Second,more acute change.
首先 是渐进式变化 之后 是突发式变化

408
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,540
The gradual change is mindful meditation.
渐进式变化是一种专注冥想

409
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:56,480
Mindful meditation is arguably the most powerful intervention
专注冥想可以带来安宁沉静

410

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,290
We're gonna spend a whole week talking about it.
我们之后会用一周的时间讲专注冥想

413
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,380
Today what I wanna do is just to introduce it,the basic,
今天我只想做一个简单的介绍

414
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,930
the foundation of the spiral of mindfulness.
讲一下专注力的螺旋曲线

415
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,050
Jon Kabatt-Zin who in many ways,
从许多方面来说Jon Kabatt-Zin

416
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,310
is responsible for bringing serious research into this realm.
在这个学科领域做了很多重要的研究

417

The path to it in any moment lies no farther than your own body
通向这个境界的路径就在

425
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,580
and mind and your own breathing."
你的体内 脑中 和你自己的呼吸里"

The result that you'll see that I'll talk about
当我们讲到这些研究的时候 你们会看到

428
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,520
when we talk about research,quite literally mind-boggling.
那些研究结果是多么令人难以置信

429

I mean they change the way our mind works,

What we'll see when we talk about research

This is gradual, slow,

这是一个终身疗法

Here is an example of more acute change

00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,120
when it comes to our emotion.
分析我们的情感 所以

507
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,450
So when I thought about filling in this box in the 3 by 2 model,

508
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,990
how do I find the acute emotional change?

509
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,430
Immediately my mind went to research in clinical psychology,

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,960
And when I look at it,I said,

515
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,910
'well,this is an example of an acute change,a very acute change
'好吧 这是一个突发式变化的案例

516
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,020
Because what happens when we have a trauma,

00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,660
many people after the trauma are changed forever,

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,520
creates new neural pathways,kills a lot of old neural pathways

524
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,780
It's a sledge hammer.
一个单独的经历 就像是大锤一挥

525
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,300
It is very widespread unfortunately.
很不幸的是这是一个非常常见的疾病

526
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,120
I mentioned it last time.
我上次已经说过了

527
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:30,680
30 percent of Vietnam vets have PTSD.30 percent.

30%之多 80%的第一次海湾战争老兵

529
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:35,940
As I mention
有创伤后应激障碍 我之前也提过

530
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,930
we don't have the exact data yet from the second Gulf War.
我们现在还没有关于第二次海湾战争

531
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,570
But the numbers are likely gonna be higher than that.
的确切数据 但是相信人数只会更多不会更少

532
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:48,670
After 911 or before 911 right,there were 20,000 individuals
在911之前 在纽约110号大街以南

533
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,420
with PTSD south of 110th street New York.
有两万人有创伤后应激障碍

534
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,870
Right after 911,

60,000 individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder.

537
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,570
Again it has consequences on the way our brain functions,
影响了我们的大脑功能

538
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,020
very often,not always,but very often for the rest of our lives.
这种影响很多时候是终其一生的

539
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,220
So this is an acute change.
这就是突发式的变化

540
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,910
It comes immediately one trauma,
伴随着创伤而来

541
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,130
911 or seeing something terrible in war.
比如911 或者在战争中的恐怖经历

542
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,570
And then that often has an effect for the rest of,
从而影响了余生

543
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,200
for the per..,for the entire life.
影响了整个人生

544
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,440
It's a shock treatment,a negative shock treatment.
这是一种休克疗法 消极的休克疗法

545
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,420
Now when look at PTSD when I thought about it,I asked,
当我想到创伤后应激障碍的时候

546
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,000
‘OK,so what is positive psychology have to do with this.'
我问'OK 这和积极心理学有啥关系'

547
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,150
I mean this is clinical psychology.
这属于临床心理学的范畴 就是所谓的

548
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,900
This is ”negative psychology”.Well the answer is a lot.
消极心理学 但是其实有很大关系

549
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,420
First of all,a lot of research started only 1998,
首先 从1998年起开始有很多相关研究

550
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,090
again,10 years ago,
仅仅是在10年以前 就是在

551
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,240
the time when positive psychology came in to the scene,
人们开始关注幸福心理学的时候

552
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,950
research on post-traumatic growth.
开始有很多关于创伤后成长的研究

553
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,330
And what was found was that in fact more people experience growth
研究发现 实际上更多的人在经历创伤后

554
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,770
as a result of a trauma than post,than PTSD.
得到的是成长 而不是应激障碍

555
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,940
However,we don't talk about post-traumatic growth.
然而 没人提起创伤后成长

556
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,160
Everyone knows about PTSD.
每个人都知道创伤后应激障碍

557
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,250
But again this is another example of where the light is not shed
但是再次说明了 这又是一个关于

558
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,860
on something that is actually working well.
人们不愿去关注正面事物的案例

559
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,130
And what is working here?
如何正面呢 就是大部分人

560
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,130
Most people are extremely resilient able to withstand trauma.
其实是非常有能力去承受创伤的

561
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,240
And that is a very empowering understanding to have.
这是一个非常振奋人心的事实

562
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,220
We'll become more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,
如果人们知道这是可能实现的

563
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,740
and more people will experience post-traumatic growth
是常见的 如果人们不会对经历

564
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,880
if they only knew that it was a possibility that it was common.
创伤后成长感到愧疚 那么

565
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,160
If they didn't feel guilty about experiencing growth
我们就会有更多自我实现的预言

566
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,670
as a result of trauma.
也会有更多人拥有创伤后成长的经历

567
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,150
How can I grow after what I saw,what I visioned,
在我经历了越南战争之后 有了

568
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,050
what I experienced in Vietnam.It's wrong.
那样的所见所闻 我怎么会成长呢?

569
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,860
Again things don't happen for the best.
这是不对的 再说一次 世事总有不幸

570
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,650
But some people are able to make the best of things that happen.
但是有些人能尽量从世事中受益

571
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,760
Post-traumatic growth,

00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,960
it happens when people begin to focus on the benefit.

So what is the benefit of this trauma.

574
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,960
It didn't happen for the best.
发生这种事终归是不幸的

575
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,130
But what if I learn from my cancer for example.

576
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,000
Well,to be closer to my family,to appreciate the breath,

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,080
to appreciate the flowers,to enjoy my friends more.

But I'm gonna make…I did make the best of it.

580
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,370
Benefit finding.
这就是价值发现

581
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,240
Or many people are able to find meaning in it through journaling.

We'll talk about journaling next class.

588
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,690
Going back to the Lyubomirsky study.
只是反复去想 回到我们之前说的

589
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,810
And when you just ruminate without sharing,
Lyubomirsky的研究 当你只想不说

590
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,630
without,without taking it out.
不把心里话倒出来

591
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,850
It becomes stronger and it's more likely to become PTSD.

592
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,710
But it doesn't always do that.
创伤后应激障碍 并不一定要这样

593
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,070
And it's important to understand

594
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,510
the magnetism of post-traumatic growth.
是至关重要的

595
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,030
So here is the question that I have.
那么现在我向大家提一个问题

596
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,790
This is a positive psychology course.
既然这是讲幸福心理学的课程

597
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,090
Remember what positive psychology is;
大家应该还记得幸福心理学

598
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,390
is that it focuses on what works.
关注的是有用的有效的事物

599
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,120
So the question that I asked myself
因此在备课的时候

600
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,260
as I was preparing for this course was this.
我问了自己一个问题

601
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,980
Is there a positive equivalent to trauma,
有没有一个正面的和创伤相对应的元素

602
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,100
something that is so powerful yet positive
它的效果强大 但同时是正面积极的

603
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,040
that will change the way our brain functions
并最终能像猛击大锤一样

604
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,630
in an instance like a sledgehammer?
瞬间改变我们大脑的运作模式?

605
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,550
Is there something like that? Or in other words,what I asked is,
有这样的元素吗?换句话说 我想问

606
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,940
can a single positive experience create a positive channel
会不会有一种正面的经历可以创造

607
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,830
that will lead to a permanent increase in wellbeing,
一条正向的通道 引领我们得到更多

608
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,410
calm and positive memories.
健康 宁静 和积极的回忆 也就是说

609
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,180
In other words,the opposite of PTSD.
和创伤后应激障碍正相反的反应

610
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,900
And again asking you shall receive.A question begins a quest.
再重复一次:勤问必有所得 求索始于追问

611
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,560
And as soon as I ask this question,it open up channels that
当我问出这个问题 在我眼前立马开启了

612
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,410
I didn't see before that were literally right in front of my eyes
一条我前所未见的通道

613
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,810
And this was the work that
这就是我多年来一直钻研其中的

614
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,020
I've studied for many years of one of my intellectual heroes,
我心目中的最伟大的知识分子

615
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,740
Abraham Maslow who talks about the peak experience.
马斯洛提出的高峰体验理论

616
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,210
Now,what I'm gonna talk about now
我现在要说的这个理论 更多的

617
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,230
is more hypothesis than well grounded research.
是一种假设性理论 而未经过实证的

618
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,990
It's a hypothesis that I hope some of you will,
我希望你们当中有人能

619
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,280
will research either here as your senior thesis,
将这个假设性理论当成论文课题研究

620
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,910
or in the future,or will encourage people to research these ideas.
或者以后 能鼓励别人研究这个理论

621
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,390
Everything that I share in this class
我在这个课上讲的理论

622
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,040
is based on very rigorous research.
都是经过大量研究证实的

623
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,800
This is one area where it's a hypothesis.
只有这个领域是假设性的

624
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,320
But bear with me and see what you think of it,
但还是请大家听一下 我讲完后

625
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,820
of this hypothesis when I finish explaining it.
请好好想想这个假设性理论

626
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,760
Because there is some,some research on it,not enough,
因为虽然是有一些相关研究

627
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,290
you know for a stand of approval yet.
但是不多 不足以证实其真实性

628
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,130
But think about it.Does it make sense.
但还是请大家想想看它有没有道理

629
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,420
So let's see what is a peak experience.
那么 让我们先了解一下什么

630
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,310
Maslow's definition of a peak experience:

whether it was listening to your favourate piece of music.

Just being one with the experience,it was..um..

Many of theologians talk about as the religious experience,

Maybe not.But experience just one with everything.

Everything is right here.

Now I know I experience with my family at times.

653
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,250
You know last night having dinner with my family and friends.

Just being so complete,so in the moment.A peak experience.

657
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,970
Now these peak experiences usually don't last for very long.
高峰体验 但是这种体验一般不会长久

658
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,320
They come and they go.It's a peak.
是会消逝的 它只存在于高峰一刻

659
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,300
However,they can and often do have repercussions.

660
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,670
Now,maybe you can see now where I'm going with this.

661
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,300
So do I,what I thought about
接下来要说什么了 当我想到

662
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,840
when I thought about peak experiences was maybe,
高峰体验的时候 我发现它也许

663
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:58,030
just maybe this is the positive equivalent to the trauma.
只是也许 和创伤带来的影响是同等的

664
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,030
Maybe it's a shock treatment of ecstasy
也许它是一种喜悦式的休克疗法

665
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,530
that can have effect beyond just the experience itself,
能够带来超越体验本身的效果

666
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,820
just like PTSD has effect beyond the experience itself.
就好像创伤后应激障碍一样

667
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,130
There're people today who are living and reliving 911,
时至今日 仍有人活在911的回忆中

668
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,230
still affecting them,still affecting their brain,

00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,240
creating new channels,

01年9月11日之前并不存在的通路

671
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:35,000
So is peak experience shock treatment of ecstasy?
所以说 高峰体验是一种喜悦式的

672
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,360
If peak experience is the positive equivalent of a trauma,
休克疗法吗?如果它反面对应的是创伤

673
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,890
then the equivalent of a post-traumatic stress disorder
那么和创伤后应激障碍对应的就是

674
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,610
is what I called post peak experience order.
我管它叫高峰体验后通路

675
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,210
I know,cheesy.But I think there is something behind it.
我知道 是土了一点 但是我觉得

676
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,090
Some research on it.Some,very,um,very little.
是有道理的 相关的研究其实很少

677
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,710
But I think it actually works.
但是我认为这理论是有效的

678
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,630
So one of the research studies
其中一个研究

679
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,520
that was done it was by one of Maslow's student.
是由马斯洛的一个学生做的

680
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,080
She studied,um women after child birth.

And what she found was that sometimes,
她发现在一些时候

682
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,910
not always,in fact not most times,
这种情况并不是大多数 妇女有时候

683
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,580
but often these women experience peak experience.
在生小孩的时候会有高峰体验

684
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,690

00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,550
As a result of it,they became more confident,

686
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,090
more generous and benevolent,and happier,

687
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,770
just as a result of a single experience,
一切都源于一个单独的人生体验

688
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,230
a shock treatment of ecstasy,something which was,
一种喜悦休克疗法 这种体验

689
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,810
which happened to them,which meant so much to them.
发生在她们身上 对她们意义非凡

690
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,590
Now they did this research in the early 50s or late,
这个实验是在50年代初期做的

691
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,310
no,early 50s.
还是晚期 不 是50年代初

692
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,050
Today it may also happen more often with men because
现在 这种情况对于男士也更常见了

693
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,150
men today are more likely to be present when the child is born.
因为现在的男士比起以前更可能

694
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,770
I know that in my…when David was born,
出现在孩子出生的现场 当我儿子

695
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,930
you know I burst out crying.
David出生的时候 我当场喜极而泣

696
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,590
It was a very powerful experience when it happened;
对于我来说 那是一种非常强烈的

697
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,060
certainly peak experience for me.
体验 绝对是一种高峰体验

698
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,360
Here's what Maslow says about peak experiences.And
下面是马斯洛对于高峰体验的阐释

699
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,560
again not talking specifically about post peak experience order,
他没明白说就是高峰体验后通路

700
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,120
but alluding to it.
但是也算是一种暗示

701
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,400
‘Peak experiences often have consequences...
'高峰体验通常会带来一些后果

702
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,900
They can do the same there as psychotherapy,
效果等同于心理疗法

703
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,860
if one keeps his goals right,
前提是体验者目标明确

704
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,370
and if one knows just what he is about,
有自知之明

705
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,710
and if one is conscious of what he is going toward.
并且清楚自己的方向

706
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,030
We can certainly talk,on the one hand,
一方面 我们当然可以只讨论

707
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,870
of the breaking up of symptoms,like the breaking up of cliches,
怎么分解症状 怎么老调重弹

708
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,160
of anxieties,or the like; or on the other hand,
分解焦虑 或其它问题 另一方面 我们

709
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,140
we can talk about the development of spontaneity,and of courage,
还可以去探讨怎么培养自主性和勇气

710
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,690
and of Olympian or Godlike humor and suchness,
怎么培养奥运选手 幽默感 诸如此类

711
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,680
sensory awareness,body awareness,and the like.'
感知认识 身体感知 和其它.'

712
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,050
So what he's saying here is that these effects
所以他的意思是说 如果我们做一些

713
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,900
can have consequences beyond just the peak experience
事后跟进的工作 那么会产生一些具有

714
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,810
if we do certain thing such as follow up on it.
影响力的效果 而不仅仅是高峰体验

715
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,850
William James in The Varieties of Religious Experiences talks about
W. James在'宗教经验多样化'一书中

716
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,210
such moments that change lives and how they change lives.
谈到改变人生的时刻 以及它们

717
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,530
Peak experience can quite literally lead to a new brain order.
怎样改变人生 高峰体验可以创造

718
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,350
And again the jury still out on the research.
新的大脑结构 虽然相关问题

719
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,320
But there's more and more suggestions.
仍待研究 但已有越来越多的迹象

720
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,400
And we'll talk about it next time as well
显示这是有迹可寻的

721
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,160
that show that there is something there,
如果我们知道该怎么做 高峰体验

722
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,560
that it can be the positive equivalent of a trauma
可以产生和创伤相对应的正面效应

723
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,500
if we know what we do,to do with it.
下次我们会详细讲这部分的内容

724
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,420
And here's the important issue.
现在我们要说一个很关键的问题

725
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,880
The question is first
首先 我们会有高峰体验吗

726
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,820
do we experience peak experiences and experience more of them?
我们能有更多的高峰体验吗?

727
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,660
And second,after we experience peak experience,
其次 在我们经历了高峰体验之后

728
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,260
how can we make it more likely that we enjoy PPEO?
我们怎样做才能获得高峰体验后通路?

729
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,960
Because just like not everyone after a trauma experience PTSD.
因为正如同 并不是所有人都会经历

730
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,930
In fact,the majority don't.Just in the same way,
创伤后应激障碍 事实上大部分人没有

731
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,540
most people don't experience PPEO after a peak experience.
同样 大部分人在高峰体验过后

732
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,100
How do you increase the likelihood,
并未获得高峰体验后通路

733
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,790
first of increasing peak experience and second of increasing
怎样增加首先是高峰体验发生的概率

734
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,860
the likelihood of post peak experience order.
其次是高峰体验后通路的概率

735
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,650
So to enhance peak experience,
因此 怎么增强高峰体验

736
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,840
just very briefly because essentially the course is about that.
这堂课基本上讲的就是关于这个内容

737
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,040
So I'm gonna just throw out a few ideas that
现在我要讲几个概念 当中有

738
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,530
we've talked about and some that we'll talk about.
我们以前讲过的 也有之后要讲的

739
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,780
First,permission to be human.Acceptance,accepting emotions.
首先 全然为人 接纳 接纳你的情绪

740
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,890
Why? Because if we don't accept painful emotions,
为什么呢 因为如果我们不能接受

741
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,440
if we don't give ourselves permission to be human,
痛苦的情绪 如果我们不能让自己

742
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,150
we're blocking our emotional pathways.
全然为人的 我们就阻断了自己的

743
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,550
And positive emotions and painful emotions
情绪通路 而所有积极和痛苦的

744
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,550
often flow through the same emotional pathways.
情绪都流动于同一条情绪通路

745
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,730
And when we're limiting one,we're very often limiting the other.
当我们限制其一的时候 我们也限制了

746
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,140
So if we open up the pathways,
另一方 因此如果我们开启通路

747
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,130
give ourselves the permission to be human
接受自己全然为人

748
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,030
and give ourselves the permission to cry
无论是出于悲伤或极度的喜悦

749
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,130
when we're sad or ecstatic.
允许自己哭泣

750
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,910
That very often opens up,
我们就能开启通路

751
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,560
makes it more likely that we experience positive emotions as well
让自己更容易感受到积极的情绪

752
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,660
Paradoxical,
看似矛盾

753
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,530
but this is the paradox of the permission to be human.
但这就是全然为人的隽语

754
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,310
When we give ourselves permission to experience painful emotions,
当我们允许自己感受痛苦的情绪

755
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,970
we're more likely to experience the positive emotions.
我们就会更容易感受到积极的情绪

756
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,840
Mindfulness,being present.
还有就是 专注力 感受当下

757
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,470
Lot of time when we are listening to music,
举个例子 很多时候 当我们听音乐

758
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,500
for example,really listening to music,
就是全神贯注的听音乐的时候

759
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,180
not just having it as background while text messaging,
不是放着背景音乐 在一边发短信

760
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,200
doing homework,and talking to our friends.
做功课 和朋友聊天

761
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,940
But when we really listen to music that we love,
而是全神贯注的听我们喜欢的音乐

762
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,480
very often we have a peak experience being present.
很多时候 我们会有临场的高峰体验

763
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,270
According to Maslow's research,
根据马斯洛的理论

764
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,670
these are two of the most likely,
这两个条件能令我们最可能

765
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:54,010
most likely areas where we can experience the peak experience.
获得高峰体验

766
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,090
And by the way this I believe is,is innate.
顺便说一下 我相信这也是一种天赋

767
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,310
You know even I see with,with Sherio,my one year old daughter.
我从我一岁的女儿Sherio身上看到了

768
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,130
You know when there is music,when we dance,she laughs.
这种天赋 每当音乐响起 我们随之起舞

769
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,310
This is not something we taught her.
她就会开心的笑 这不是我们教她的

770
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,980
We were born with,with this inclination for music and dance.
人对音乐和舞蹈的爱好是天生的

771
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,240
We need to take time for that.Having a meaningful goal.
我们需要花时间去发掘这种天赋

772
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,290
When we're on purpose,
制定一个有意义的目标

773
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,490
when we're doing things that we love to do,when what we are,
当我们有所追求 做自己爱做的事情

774
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,830
we are doing is meaningful and significant to us,
做自己觉得有意义 重要的事情

775
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,060
we're much more likely to experience peak experiences.
我们更容易获得高峰体验

776
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,040
Finally one of the greatest barriers in our culture,time.
最后 我们当今文化中最严重的问题

777
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,450
It's very difficult to experience peak experiences
时间 当我们匆匆忙忙赶时间 倍感

778
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,340
when we're on the rush,when we're stressed and anxious.
倍感压力和焦虑的时候 我们很难

779
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,740
These are peak experience killers.
获得高峰体验 这些都是高峰体验杀手

780
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,350
Whether it's when making love,
无论是在做爱的时候

781
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,610
whether it's when listening to music,
还是听音乐的时候

782
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,120
whether it's with when spending time with friends,
或者和朋友一起的时候

783
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,090
or all of the above together.
当所有这些发生情况的时候 都一样

784
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,440
How do we enhance the likelihood of PPEO once
那么一旦有了高峰体验 我们应该如何

785
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,350
we have experienced peak experience?
增加获得高峰体验后通路的可能性呢

786
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,070
First thing,replaying an image.
首先 我们可以重演画面

787
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,010
Remember the mind
还记得吗 我们说过大脑

788
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,910
doesn't know the difference within the imaginary and the real.
并不能分辨真实和想象

789
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,480
It plays it over and over again.
它可以将发生过的画面多次重播

790
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,670
And when we play it over and over again,
当我们多次重播该画面的时候

791
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,940
the neural pathway is reinforced.
神经通路得到了巩固

792
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,180
The sledge hammer begins the neural pathway.
这条通路由大锤凿开

793
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,570
And then we reinforce it through replaying through imagination.
之后我们通过画面重演来巩固它

794
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Writing about it.
我们还可以把经历写出来

795
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,550
This is gonna be a response paper next week.
下周我们的心得报告作业

796
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,750
Writing about a peak experience.
就是要大家写自己的高峰体验

797
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,880
When we journal about it,describing it,not analyzing it.
当我们记录这种体验的时候 只是描述

798
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,810
Remember the difference with Lyubomirsky.Positive emotions,
而不是分析 记住Lyubomirsky说的两者差别

799
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,080
positive experiences is not as helpful to analyze.
正面的情绪和经历不适于被分析

800
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,830
So just to describe it,once again reinforce the neural pathways.
所以 只要去描述这种经历

801
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,190
We relive it.We replay it.
再次巩固神经通路

802
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,350
Once again taking time,taking time.
花时间去重演 花时间去重播它

803
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,850
And finally taking action
最后 就是要采取行动

804
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,300
which is how we can reinforce the initial experience of the,
通过采取行动 我们能巩固最初的体验

805
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,990
um,the peak experience,reinforce the neural pathways.
即高峰体验 巩固神经通路

806
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,210
So I had it inside,
所以说 当我有了高峰体验之后

807
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,240
an Ah-ha moment as a result of this peak experience.
我心里会感到柳暗花明 豁然开朗

808
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,830
Now I'm gonna do something about it and act,
现在我得付诸行动

809
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:20,510
which leads me to the second point,which is B-behavior.
这也是我今天要讲的第二部分-行为

810
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,920
I've been teaching and participating in workshops
20年来 自从我还未满20岁的时候开始

811
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,330
and seminars and classes on self improvement psychology,
我就一直在教和参与各类关于

812
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,450
positive psychology and clinical psychology for almost 20 yeas
自我提升心理学 幸福心理学

813
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,710
since I was,since I was,well before I was 20.
临床心理学的课程 讲习班和研讨会

814
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,200
And what I noticed in other people's workshops,
我发现 不管是在别人的讲习班上

815
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,730
or in my workshops in seminars in classes is the following.
还是自己的讲习班上

816
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,080
Most people,if the workshop or the class is good,
如果课程效果好的话 大部分人

817
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,610
exit the classroom,or the weekend or the semester.
在周末或期末离开的时候

818
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,330
If they were here before,
如果之前他们在这里

819
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,950
they usually experience a relative high after.
之后他们都会经历一个高峰

820
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,830
But there're two groups of people.
但是一般人会分为两组

821
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,600
Both groups experience a relative high.
两组人都会经历高峰

822
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,600
The first group which unfortunately are the majority.
第一组人 很不幸这组人占大多数

823
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:28,000
After that high,go back to their base level of happiness,
在经历了高峰之后 最后回到了原来的

824
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,710
something we're familiar with.
幸福基点 我们对此并不陌生

825
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,650
The second group,not majority,
第二组人 不是多数

826
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,770
but not a small minority experience that high after.
是一小部分人 在经历了高峰之后

827
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,680
That high doesn't last forever.
这种高峰并不持久

828
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,550
However,they go back,but when they go back,
但是当他们落下来的时候

829
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,180
their base level of wellbeing is higher than it was before.
他们的幸福基点比之前高出来

830
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,690
And they continue to have their vicissitudes,
之后尽管也有起起伏伏

831
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:57,310
but this time along a higher base level of happiness than before.
但是都是在这个新基点上下起伏

832
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,330
Now needless to say,
不用说 我当然很想

833
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:04,030
I want to understand why people experience this,
知道为什么有些人是这样

834
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,060
some people and other people experience this,
另一些人是那样

835
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,990
because I want people who take my class
因为我想让参加我课程的人能拥有

836
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,890
to enjoy lasting change as opposed to temporary.
持久性的变化 而不是昙花一现的改变

837
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,090
Nice,feels good,not enough.
只是短暂的感觉良好是不够的

838
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,110
It doesn't justify the effort that they put into the workshop.
这既对不住他们为课程所付出的努力

839
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,220
And it doesn't justify the effort that I put into my work.
也对不住我为课程付出的努力

840
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,650
So I want to understand the difference between the two.
所以我很想弄明白两者之间的差异

841
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,070
And here is the single most important difference
下面就是我发现的这两组人

842
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,680
that I identified between these two groups.
之间存在的最重要的差异

843
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,920
Group 2,the distinguishing characteristic
第二组人所具备的显著特点

844
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,860
was that after the workshop or class or seminar,
就是在讲习班或课程或研讨会结束之后

845
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,430
not at the end of the semester if it was a semester long class,
会立刻做出行为上的改变

846
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,550
after each class or after many of the classes
如果是一个学期的课程 他们不是在学期

847
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,830
introducing immediate behavioral change.
结束后才做 而是每节课或几节课之后就做

848
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,700
They don't wait and say ‘ok,after this course is over,
他们不会边等边说'好吧 等课程全结束了

849
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,240
I'll reevaluate my life and see how I do.
我到时再重新评估人生 看自己能做什么'

850
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,660
Immediately introducing real behavioral change,
而是立刻采取实质上的行为改变

851
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:05,090
doing exercises that we talked about in class,
比如 做一些上课讲过的练习

852
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,310
taking risks that they haven't before
学着承担以前不敢承担的风险

853
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,530
but introducing change immediately,not waiting.
总之 立刻改变 而不是等着

854
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,060
And those introduce change immediately
而这些立刻改变的人并不会因此

855
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,500
don't have a high or peak experience constantly.

857
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,460
as opposed to going down returning to

858
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,410
where it was before when there was no behavioral change.
而回落到和以前一样的水平

859
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,910
And now I start every workshop and seminar
所以 现在每当我有长达数天的

860
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,030
when I have a few day workshop
讲习班和研讨会 我都会在一开始就

861
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,350
or seminar introducing this model of change.
给大家介绍这种变化的模式

862
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,480
What do we know from a lot of research in psychology
我们从很多心理学研究中学到

863
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:43,310
is there is a relationship between attitudes and behaviors.
态度和行为是密切相关的

864
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,060
And we talked about it,we illuded into it already in the past.
这一点我们以前讲过 提到过

865
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,040
So we all have attitudes whether it's attitudes about psychology,
所以说我们都有自己的态度 无论是关于

866
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,760
whether it's attitudes about another person,
心理学的态度 还是关于其他人

867
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,640
whether it's attitude about myself.
或是关于自己的态度

868
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,050
And these attitudes affect our behavior.
这些态度影响着我们的行为

869
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,960
So for example,if I have a positive attitude towards psychology
比如说 如果我对心理学 或是幸福心理学

870
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,590
or positive psychology,I'm more likely to take 1504 than
抱有好感 相对于对心理学

871
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,050
if my attitude towards psychology
完全没好感的状况

872
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,600
and positive psychology is negative.
我更有可能去选1504这门课

873
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:12,100
Or if I have a good attitude toward a certain belief
或者说 如果我对一种想法

874
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,480
about a certain person,
或对一个人有好感

875
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,890
I'm much more likely to want befriend this person
比起对其毫无好感的情况

876
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,680
if I like him than if I don't.
我更有可能和他成为朋友

877
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,010
So attitudes affect behavior.
所以说 态度影响行为

878
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,340
That's very clear,easy to understand.
这是显而易见的 很容易理解

879
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,830
But what psychologists have found,
但是一些心理学家 包括Alice Eagly

880
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:33,820
the likes of Alice Eagly,Daryl Bem and others.
Daryl Bem和其他一些人

881
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:38,570
What they have found is that behavior also affects attitude.
他们发现行为同样也能影响态度

882
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,050
It works both ways.
这是一条双行线

883
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,310
So if I behave in a certain way,
所以说如果我有某种行为模式

884
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,610
it is likely to change my attitude in accordance with my behavior
我的行为很可能会改变我相应的态度

885
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,770
And remember we talked about it.
这个问题我们以前也讲过

886
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,950
Why? Because we have an attitude.
为什么呢?因为如果说我们有某种态度

887
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,230
And our behavior is the outside world.
我们的行为就好像外在的世界

888
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,330
The mind doesn't like
我们的大脑不能接受

889
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,110
when there is incongruence between the inside and outside.
内在和外在不一致的情况

890
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,200
So if we behave in a certain way,
因此如果我们的行为是这样的

891
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,740
the attitude is gonna be pulled down to reflect that behavior.
那我们的态度就会被拉下来

892
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,660
If we behave in this way,
和行为相对应 如果我们的行为是这样

893
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:10,560
the attitude the mind doesn't like incongruence,
大脑不喜欢不一致的情况

894
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,780
it's going to create equality between the two,
它就会让两者达到对等

895
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,970
congruency consistency between the two.
让两者之间达到一致 谐调

896
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,120
And the way it'll do that is either by changing our behavior,
方法就是要不然改变我们的行为 或者

897
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:24,640
and here is the key,or more often by changing our attitude.
这点很关键-更多时候 改变我们的态度

898
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,090
Now all of us here,
我们在场的所有人 不管你是

899
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:34,440
whether you are 18 or whether you are 80,we all have habits.
18岁还是80岁 我们都有自己的习惯

900

And again,we first make our habits and then our habits make us.

906
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,730
after the class the mind looks for consistency.
