00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,890
Just a couple of announcements.

Questions that I received via email.
我通过邮件收到的几个问题

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,620
A few things before we jump into the material.
在开始课程之前我要说的几件事情

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,320
First of all,I was asked,"who is this class for?
首先 有人问我"这门课程是为谁设置的?"

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,070
Is it for people-- you know it's positive psychology --
"这是积极心理学"

10
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,860
people that are very unhappy?

Is it only for people who are depressed?

who is this class for?"

Well,the class is for anyone who is interested in

Positive psychology and anyone who wants to be happier.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,510
If you are extremely happy,you can still be happier.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,560
If you are very unhappy,you can still be happier.
如果你非常不开心 你也可以更开心

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,820
so the class essentially is for anyone

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,400
who's interested in the material-
对它感兴趣的人

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,680
and I would add someone who is really interested to work,
我会邀请有兴趣投入

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,020
to put the kind of effort that we talked about last time.
我们上次谈到的那种努力的人上来

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,610
Just not the kind of effort that we would require you to
你不需要投入那种

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,520
wreck your head about understanding certain concept,
为了明白某个概念而大为头痛的努力

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,210
but it is effort in terms of applying these ideas to your lives.
而是努力把这些观念融入你的生活

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,680
Now you may want to take this class,
也许你之所以上这门课程

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,230
because you are interested on academic level in positive
是因为你对积极心理学的理论感兴趣

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,380
psychology that's perfectly fine.
这也没问题

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,340
And you'll get many--
你将会得到很多...

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,960
we'll talk about numerous studies in every lecture,
我们每节课都会谈到非常多的研究

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,390
starting next time.
从下节课开始

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,330
We'll talk about study after study after study,
我们将接二连三地谈到那些研究

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,160
so you'll get that element as well.
所以你也可以得到理论方面的知识

32
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,900
However,if you are thinking about taking positive psychology
但是 如果你修积极心理学

33
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,560
for personal benefits,you need to put the effort in.
是为了个人利益 那么你就需要努力

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,970
And I'll talk more about that today.
对此今天我会作进一步的阐述

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,520
So the class is for everyone.
所以这门课程任何人都可以修

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,440
Anyone who's extremely happy and wants to be happier,

and anyone who's not happy and wants to be happier.

38
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,840
Pass/fail-- perfectly fine.
考试成绩 这不是个问题

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,010
Again the idea about this class is first and foremost for you.
这门课程的宗旨以你们的利益为上

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
So I would urge you if you do take pass
所以我建议如果你想及格

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,680
and fail to put in the work,
那么就要努力

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,010
and that's why the one element of pass/fail is not negotiable is
因此是否及格的决定因素之一

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,950
that all the response papers have to be submitted.
就是所有的回应报告必须交上来

44
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,150
Now the response papers,as you know,are not graded.
回应报告不会评分

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,490
They are basically reflection papers.
它们基本上就是心得体会

46
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,980
Will you reflect about the ideas about things
也就是你会思考能够融入

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,690
that can be applied to your life?
你的生活的想法和事情吗?

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,220
But they are required.
它们是必需要交的

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,100
So you hand them in,you pass.
你交上来 你就及格

50
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,900
If you don't hand them in,you fail.
不交就不及格

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,320
But other than that,by all means,
除此之外

52
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,810
if you want to take this class pass/fail,it's perfectly fine.
如果你想参加考试 那也没问题

53
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,320
Third thing,

you'll be exposed to many theories,to many ideas in this class.
在这门课程你将会接触很多理论和观点

55
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,290
Not everything would resonate of you.
不是所有理论观点都会引起你的共鸣

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,340
There's a wonderful book just came out in 2008,

59
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,880
And there she talks about the concept--

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,760
she's a professor at Riverside (UC),

she talks about the importance of finding fit,

63
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,360
meaning the fit between certain technique,

64
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,020
or tool,or idea,and yourself.
某种工具 某种观点是否适合你

65
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,960
Not every idea,
并不是你听到的每种观点

66
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,680
not every study that you've heard about,
每种研究

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,830
not every intervention that you actually practice

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,520
and you will practice interventions in your life,

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,480
whether it's doing acts of kindness,

00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,060
whether it's expressing gratitude,

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,930
whether it's physical exercising,whether it's journaling.

72
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,070
You will do all these things throughout the semester.
这些事情你在整个学期里都要做

73
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,590
Not everything would be right for you.
然而并不是一切都适合你

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,140
You'll be exposed to it.
你将会接触它

And then you'll make up your mind,

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,590
"yes,this is what I want to incorporate"

78
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,960
or "no,this is just not relevant for me."
或者"不 它对我没什么意义"

79
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,750
So it's important to keep that in mind.
所以记住这一点很重要

80
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,790
Anything that I talk about is backed by research,
我所说的一切都有研究论证

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,500
but the research doesn't say it's right for everyone.
但是研究没有说它适合所有人

82
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,800
It says it's for most people or for many people;
它说这对于大多数人或者对于很多人

83
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,290
this has worked or it is working.
都有作用或者正在起作用

84
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,940
So again be an active participant in this class
所以你要积极参与到课程中

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,660
as opposed to passive recipient of a doctrine.
而非某种学说的被动接受者

86
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,510
And identify the things that work for you-- not everything.
鉴别哪些东西适合你...不是一切东西

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,010
I guarantee not everything will work for you,
我敢说并非一切东西都适合你

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,460
but a lot of things will.
但是有很多东西会适合你

And when I think about it and I look into it,
当我思考它调查它的时候

294
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,580
I think that psychology needs help.
我觉得心理学需要帮助

295
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,780
I really do.
我真的这样觉得

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,420
I mean think about it at a personal level.
你可以从个人的角度想想它

297
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:13,590
that if you had a person who 21 hours a day was depressed
如果一个人一天里有21小时感到消沉

298
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,520
and one hour in a day felt good?
而只有一个小时感觉良好会怎样?

299
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,500
Or one day feeling good and then 21 days feeling anxious
或者有一天感觉良好 便有21天觉得焦虑

300
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,270
and depressed?

301
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,080
You would say that this person would need help.

302
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,150
And the field I think,needs help.
我觉得这个领域需要帮助

303
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,160
But the question becomes "is it the right analogy?"
但问题是 这是正确的比喻吗?

304
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,570
Should we look at it this way?
我们应该这样去看待它吗?

305
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,710
Because the 21 ratio is unhealthy,
因为21比1的比率是不健康的

306
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,730
certainly would be so on the individual level,
从个人的角度来看肯定也是这样

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,680
but it reflects reality in many ways.
但是它从多个角度反映了现实

308
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,190
Because what we are seeing today

309
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,190
in more and more research showing that there is more and more
是越来越多的研究表明

depression around the world,

around the world.

313
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,500

people who argue for continuing to do research in this area,
那些主张继续研究这片领域

315
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,990
for doing less in positive psychologies,--

316
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,450
well we should be doing even more than the 21 to 1 ratio,
我们应该让这个比率大于21比1

317
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,620
because we want to alleviate the anxiety

320
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,790
Now part of it is because there's more awareness,
部分的原因是人们的意识程度高了

321
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,960
because we measure better.
我们对抑郁症的诊断更准确

322
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,340
But that's not all.
但这并非全部原因

323
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,120
It's also simply because objectively there's more depression.
还因为抑郁症在客观上增加了

324
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,820
And one way of knowing that is that the most objective "measure"

that we have is unfortunately suicide.

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,410
is the shift of the pendulum.

So it's no longer 21 to 1.

342
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,880
There are more,many more studies in positive psychology,

414
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,640
but again what I'm going to argue for in this class
但是在这个课程里我要主张的是

415
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,850
is that we do need to also,
我们也要...

416
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,410
not only,not exclusively,not even necessarily primarily,
不是专门 也不用主要

417
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,870
we need to also focus on the positive.
我们也要集中研究积极心理学

418
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,830
I am going to talk about three reasons why we should do that.
我要说三个为什么应该这样做的理由

419
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,940
The first reason is that it is important to focus on what works,
首先 集中研究有用的东西至关重要

420
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,320
because what works or what we focus on rather creates reality.
因为有用的或者集中研究的会成为现实

421
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,550
If we focus on what is working,
如果我们集中研究起作用的

422
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,810
we'll have more working in our world,
它就会在世界起更大的作用

423
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,120
more working in ourselves,more working in our relationships.
在我们身上以及关系上起更大作用

424
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,200
The second reason why positive psychology
其次 为什么积极心理学

425
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,440
as an independent field of study as a course in
作为一门独立领域的研究学科

426
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,700
and of itself is important is that being happy
是重要的 这是因为快乐

427
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,500
is not just the negation of happiness.
并非只是对痛苦的否定

428
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,720
It doesn't mean just get rid of depression or anxiety
摆脱我正在经历的

429
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,800
that I am experiencing,
抑郁或者焦虑并不意味着

430
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,120
I spontaneously become happy.
我同时就变得快乐了

431
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,660
That's not the case. That's not how it works.
情况并非是这样 问题不会这样被解决

432
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,790
And finally,prevention which is very important today,
最后 预防在今天来说非常重要

433
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,840
the most effective way of preventing hardship,
预防困苦最有效的方法...

434
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,400
-- whether it's depression,whether it's anxiety,
不管是抑郁还是焦虑

435
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,630
-- is actually by focusing on and cultivating the positive.
实际上是通过专注于培养积极心态

436
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,140
Now I will share with you some studies about this.
我会跟你们分享一些关于这点的研究

437
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,130
So for these three reasons,we need positive psychology.
这三个原因表明我们需要积极心理学

438
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,730
Let me begin with the importance of focusing on what works.
我从专注于有效方法的重要性开始

439
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,690
In the introduction to the Handbook of Positive Psychology,
在《积极心理学手册》的序言里

440
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,830
Martin Seligman who we talked about last time,
我们上次提到的Martin Seligman...

441
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,550
considered the father of positive psychology,
他被认为是积极心理学之父

442
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,420
network of scholars,says this:
影响了很多学者 他说

443
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,200
"The aim of positive psychology is to catalyze a change
"积极心理学的目标是促成一种变化"

444
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,830
in psychology from a preoccupation only with repairing the worst
"让心理学从只关注补救生活中最糟糕的事"

445
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,100
things in life to also building the best qualities in life."
"到同时建立生活中最美好的事"

446
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,670
Note that he says also.
请留意他说的是同时

447
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,730
He doesn't say exclusively or even primarily.
他没有说专门 甚至没有说主要

448
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,090
It's important to focus on what works,
专注于研究有效的东西至关重要

449
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,420
-- whether it is in our relationship,whether it's in ourselves,
不管是对我们的关系 对我们自身

450
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,230
whether it's in others,whether it's in Harvard,
对其他人 对哈佛

451
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,130
whether it's in United States or the world--
对美国还是对世界而言

452
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,890
in order to have more what works.
这是为了获得更多有效的东西

453
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,020
Now the question is "how do we focus on what works?"
问题是"如何专注于研究有效的东西?"

454
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,840
And the answer to this question
这个问题的答案

455
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,070
is through the questions that we ask.
就在我们提出的问题的本身

456
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,500
Let me illustrate through a case study.
我通过一个案例研究来阐明这点

457
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,410
Psychologists,starting in the late 1940s,
心理学家在20世纪40年代末开始

458
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,240
studied at-risk population.
研究受危人群

459
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,720
More and more money-- government money,university money,
越来越多的钱 政府资金 大学资金

460
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,460
philanthropist money-- went into study in the cities or places
慈善基金都投入到研究城市或地区里

461
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,440
where generally the kids were considered at risk--
所谓的受危儿童的身上

462
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,160
more prone to dropping out of school,
他们更容易退学

463
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,650
more prone to later-on crime,teen pregnancy and so on.
以后更容易犯罪 少女妊娠等等

464
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,200
So this study they put in a lot of money,
他们为这项研究投入了大量金钱

465
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,230
a lot of effort into this.

466
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,870
The question that the psychologists asked was
心理学家们问的问题是

467
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,530
"why do these individuals fail?
"为什么这些人会失败"

468
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
why does such a high percentage of students in
"为什么受危人群中"

469
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,210
that as-risk population end up dropping out of school?
"有如此高比例的学生退学?"

470
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,110
Getting pregnant? Crime?"
"怀孕?犯罪?"

471
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,170
--And we'll talk about the statistics later on next week.
我们下周再谈统计数据

472
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,700
"Why do so many of these individuals fail?"
"为什么他们当中有这么多人会失败?"

473
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,270
Now an important question,
他们提出了很重要的问题

474
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,390
good intentions of the psychologists,smart people,lot of money,

lot of resources going in.

476
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,160
However,very little change was introduced.

00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,990
Very little change came about as results of these studies.
这些研究带来的变化微乎其微

478
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,770
And the situation in many areas continued to exacerbate.

479
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,540
Certain didn't get any better,despite the good intentions,
情况没有任何好转 虽然动机良好

480
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,500
despite the resources,despite the brain power
虽然资源充足 虽然人们头脑灵活

481
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,030
that twined into the researching into this question.
它们都被投入去研究这个问题

482
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,500
Interesting answers--
得到的答案却非常有意思

483
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,420
well,we need better education,we need better buildings,
我们需要更好的教育 更好的建筑

484
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,270
we need more resources,
更多的资源

485
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,740
but very little change actually in practice came about.
但是实际上发生的变化很少

486
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,430
And then there was a paradigm,
然后出现了一种范式

487
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,140
quite literally a paradigm shift in the 1980s.
20世纪80年代出现了范式转移

488
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,110
Through the work of Antonovsky who I mentioned last time

489
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,410
and I'll mention again today,through the work of Antonovsky,
今天我要再次提到他 通过Antonovsky

490
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,120
and other people like Ellen Langer,other people like Alice Isen,
及Ellen Langer和Alice Isen等其他人的努力

491
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,490
different questions started to be asked by psychologists.

492
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,330
Instead of asking what did these individuals fail,
他们不去问为什么这些人会失败

493
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,390
positive psychologists started to ask what made some individuals

494
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,230
succeed despite unfavorable circumstances?

495
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,500
Maybe it was the case that many failed,but not everyone.
也许是有很多人失败了 但并非所有人

496
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,800
Some succeeded and succeeded big time.
有些人成功了 而且非常成功

497
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,210
And what psychologists started to do then was to ask why.
心理学家们此时便开始问 为什么

498
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,520
What is it about them that is so successful?
为什么他们如此成功?

499
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,750
And that,in the words of Frost,made all the difference.
用Frost的话来说 这才是至关重要的

500
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,840
The psychologists started to identify elements,

501
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,490
aspects of these individuals and studied them in depth,

502
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,230
starting to study the successful individuals,

503
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,860

00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,890
in creating interventions based on what they had studied.

505
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,010
And suddenly,there were results,real results,

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,470
tangible results,after decades of virtually zero results,

507
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,040
simply based on the question.
这仅仅是基于一个简单的问题

508
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,370
And the main concept that came out at that time,
那时候出现的主要概念

509
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,650
through the research of these psychologists
通过这些心理学家的研究

510

who started to ask the positive question,

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,230
started to focus on what is working on the successful children.
开始专注于研究成功的孩子们

512
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,270
The concept that came out was the concept of resilience.
那时出现的概念是心理弹性

513
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,390
Now today everyone talks about resilience.
现在大家都在谈心理弹性

514
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,880
We talk about resilience in school,

517
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,870
However,at that time in the 1980s,
然而 在20世纪80年代

518
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,730
very few people even talked about or knew what that means.
很少人谈及甚至很少人知道它的意思

519
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,670
When they studied resilience,which is defined as following,
研究心理弹性的时候 它被定义如下

520
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,370
it made all the difference.
它的定义关系重大

521
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,290

adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk.

5 years later,10 years,30 years later,

the kids who succeeded,were resilient.
这些成功的孩子都具有适应力

528
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,630
Initially,when they studied these kids,

529
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,680
the assumption was these must be super kids,extraordinary kids,

530
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,750
one in a hundred,one in a thousand-

531
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,970
not really replicable,therefore.

532
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,650

00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,980
those people who work,those people who succeeded,

535
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,420

536
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,230
-- what they found was these were not super kids.

537
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,110
In fact these were ordinary kids with ordinary characteristics
实际上这些是普通的孩子 他们性格普通

538
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,430
that led to extraordinary results.
但是成就非凡

539
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,330
For example,let me share with you some of the things.
例如 我告诉你们几件事

540
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,940
These kids were optimistic,
这些孩子都很乐观

541
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,260
-- not optimistic in the detached Pollyannish sense,
不是那种不切实际的盲目乐观

542
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,730
-- optimistic in that they believe in things
而是乐观地相信

543
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,950
that would work out well,
事情会被圆满地解决

544
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,740
and we'll talk a lot about optimism as an interpretation style,
我们会经常把乐观主义当作诠释谈及

545
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,660
in the work of Martin Seligman and karen Reivich.
也就是Martin Seligman和karen Reivich的乐观主义

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,490
They were optimistic in the sense of thinking,
他们的乐观在于认为

547
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,570
"well,it may not work well this time.

548
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,680
It will work out later.

549
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,790
I have learned from what had just happened."

They had faith and sense of meaning in life.
他们对生活有信心 认为它有意义

551
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,900
Sometimes it was religious faith,not always.

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,160
It was doing something that they really believed in.

553
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,320
Many of them were idealistic.
他们中很多人都是理想主义者

554
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,410
One of main topics we will discuss in this class is
我们在这门课程里谈及的话题之一

555
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,450
that to be idealistic is to be realistic,
就是理想主义就是现实主义

556
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,530
because we have a real internal need,innate need for idealism.
因为我们的内心需要理想主义

557
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,000
So these kids experienced sense of meaning,
所以这些孩子有"意义感"

558
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,940
whether it was meaning in terms of personal success
不管是个人成功方面的意义

559
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,870
and how I will make it,
以及他们的行事方式的意义

560
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,730
or sense of meaning in their community contributing,
或者是服务社区的意义

561
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,970
something meaningful in sense of purpose.
还有事情的目标意义

562
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,160
By the way,when I go through all these,
顺便说一下 我说的这一切

563
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,820
these are no less important for any other person in the world.
它们对所有人都一样重要

564
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,640
This resilience as we mentioned earlier
我们之前提到的心理弹性

565
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,820
is just not important for the at-risk population.
不但对受危人群很重要

566
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,090
It's as important at Harvard.
对哈佛大学里的人也一样重要

567
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,120
And not just during exam period.
也不仅是在考试期间重要

568
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,050
It's important that resilience is associated with wellbeing.
把心理弹性与幸福联系起来非常重要

569
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,760
So think about these characteristics and you display them.
思考这些特点 你就会展示它们

570
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,180
And the interesting thing about all these characteristics
我在这里提到的这些特点

571
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,550
they can all be learned.
你可以学到它们

572
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:38,860
that I'll mention here is that they can all be taught;
有趣的一点就是它们都可以习得

573
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,280
In many ways,this class is about that.
从多个方面来说 这门课程说的就是这个

574
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,350
And when the psychologists identified these,
当心理学家们识别出这些特点之后

575
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,460
they started to teach them and the individuals started to learn
他们开始教授它们 人们也开始学了

576
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,480
and that made all the difference.
情况便发生了变化

577
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,120
In addition to the faith and sense of meaning,
除了信心以及"意义感"

578
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,230
pro-social behavior,helping other people,

579
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:05,860
shifting from helplessness to helpfulness,they were significant.
从无助转变到有益 它们都非常重要

580
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,210
One of the things that we'll talk about is
我们要讨论的事情之一就是

581
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,080
how meaningful it is to help other people.
帮助他人的意义

582
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,220
And how much it doesn't just only help others,
它不但帮助他人

583
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,060
it also helps ourselves.
它还会帮助我们自己

584

873
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,310

981
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,800
I mean,look at the word,"appreciate".
看看"Appreciate"这个词

982
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,850
Two meanings: first meaning-- to say thank you for something,
它有两个意思 其一就是为某事感激

983
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,480
not to take it for granted.

We shouldn't take for granted our virtues,our successes.

But appreciate has a second meaning,which is to grow.

the good appreciates-- the good grows.
好的东西便会增值 它会增长

993
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:01,240
Unfortunately,the other side of the same coin applies as well.

00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,070
When we don't appreciate the good,

995
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:08,290
when we take it for granted,the good depreciates.
把它看作理所当然 好的东西会贬值

996

after the honeymoon phase.

And again,not to go to the point of narcissism.

in the second last lecture in the semester-

1010

narcissism is not about self-confidence,about self-esteem.

1011
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,040
It's exactly the opposite.
