9
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,230
If someone said three years from now
如果有人曾说三年以后

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,680
You'd be long gone
你早已离去

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,650
I'd stand up and punch them out
我会站起来将他们推出去

12
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,190
They'd be all wrong
因为他们都是错的

13
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,850

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,080
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Carpe Diem.Seize the day.
抓住眼前 及时行乐

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,460
So let's continue on this path and go a little bit more in depth
让我们沿着这个理念再深入一点

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,110
into this idea of self-concordance.
探讨一下自我和谐

23
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,640
What are some benefits of self-concordance?
自我和谐有什么好处呢

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,650
The first one-
自我和谐

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,850
and there are many- the first one is the obvious one.
有很多好处 其中第一点非常显而易见

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,390
You don't need to be a rocket scientist
你不需要成为一个火箭科学家

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,630
or even a social scientist to understand that
或者社会科学家 就能理解

28
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,320
setting self-concordant goals can potentially make us happier.
制定自我和谐的目标可以让我们更快乐

29
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,480
Because we are pursuing something we care about,
因为我们在追求自己在意的事

30
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,980
it is more likely to reinforce our enjoyment of the journey.
更加增加了人生旅途的乐趣

31
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,380
The second thing,in addition to increasing well being,
第二 除了增加幸福感

32
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,960
certainly connected to well being is that very often,
当然也跟幸福感紧密相关的是

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,910
having self-concordant goals- having goals in general,
制定自我和谐的目标 整体上制定目标

34
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,600
but in particular self-concordant goals,
但特别制定一些自我和谐的目标

35
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,490
resolves internal conflicts.
能解决内在的心理冲突

36
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,580
For example- it helps us deal with anxiety,
比如说 它可以帮我们解决焦虑

37
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,110
with uncertainty,with existential questions-
解决疑惑 解决有关存在的问题

38
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,650
"What am I about? What am I doing? Why am I here?"
"我是谁 我在干什么 我为什么在这儿"

39
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,480
And if you think about it,very often when we go through periods
如果你思考这些 通常是在那种

40
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,950
when we are not sure where we are going,
我们不确定该走向何方

41
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,920
where every fork in the road is about ambivalence and uncertainty
站在十字路口 前路迷雾重重的时候

42
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,940
that's when existential questions come up.
这就是有关存在的问题出现的时候

43
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,080
That's when there's uncertainty.
这就是犹豫出现的时候

44
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,620
That's when very often,there's unhappiness,
这就是不快乐出现的时候

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,100
whereas when we know what our path is,
如果我们知道我们该往哪儿走

46
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,390
it helps to resolve internal conflict.
就不会有那么多的内在心理冲突

47
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,910
An interesting way to think about it
我们可以从一个很有趣的角度来看它

48
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,110
is by drawing comparison to interpersonal conflicts.
也就是将它与人际间的冲突相对比

49
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,770
So here we are talking about intra-personal conflicts- within:
我们现在讲的是人的内在冲突 是心理内在的

50
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,780
anxiety,depression- often a result of that.
焦虑 沮丧 通常会造成类似的后果

51
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,330
But there's a lot of research on interpersonal conflicts.
有很多关于人际间冲突的研究

52
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,000
And I talked about briefly
我在讲到实践唯心主义

53
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,600
when I discussed practical idealism and conflict resolution.
以及冲突的解决时简单讲过

54
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,570
And the way to deal with the conflicts,
面对冲突的办法

55
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,000
the best way to deal with the conflicts and resolve them
面对并解决冲突的最好办法

56
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,580
is to have a super ordinate goal,
就是制定一个协调的目标

57
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,370
a goal in which both sides- both conflicting sides engage in
使得冲突的双方都参与其中

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,410
and are dependent on one another or intra-dependent.
并内在地相互依赖

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,960
And that resolves interpersonal or intergroup conflicts.
这样就能够解决人际间或组织间的冲突

60
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,590
This is work of Muzafer Sherif or Elliot Aronson.
这是Muzafer Sherif或Elliot Aronson所做的研究

61
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,000
In the same way,having a goal helps to solve internal conflicts,
同理 制定目标有助于解决内在冲突

62
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,180
intra-personal conflicts.
人内在的心理冲突

63
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,020
Because it takes our mind away from those existential,
因为它能让我们暂时忘却那些关于存在的

64
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,360
often important,but sometimes difficult questions,
很重要 但通常很难的问题

65
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,270
especially when they persist.
尤其是不断出现时

66
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,780
Away from anxiety.Away from depression.
它能使我们远离焦虑 远离沮丧

67
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,020
And we are focused on something we really,really want to do.
我们能集中精力于我们十分想做的事

68
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,210
Also,it increases the likelihood of success.
同时 它还增加了成功的可能性

69
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,140
Individuals who set self-concordant goals are more motivated-
制定了自我和谐目标的人会更有动力

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,040
they are more likely to work hard.
他们会更努力地工作

71
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,210
They are more likely to put their all in-
他们会全身心地投入到

72
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,980
whatever it is- that they are doing.
他们所做的事中去

73
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,210
In the long term,
从长远来看

74
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,540
those who pursue their passions are more likely to succeed.
那些追求自己热爱事业的人都更容易取得成功

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
Again,seems pretty straight forward,
这似乎非常直白

76
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,650
pretty self-evident common sense.
显而易见 简直是常识

77
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,290
But as we often said,common sense is not that common.
但我们常说 常识也并不是那么显而易见的

78
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,240
In many ways,
很大程度上说

79
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,570
this increased likelihood of success when we pursue the things
这种在我们追求自己热爱的事业时

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,030
that we are passionate about defines the "no pain,no gain" maxim
成功的可能性的增加 重新定义了"不劳无获"的公理

81
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,600
It defines it and changes it to the following maxim:
它将其重新定义为如下定理

82
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,030
"Do it better with pleasure."
"愉悦劳作则多获"

83
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,480
Now if you quote me on this,I'll deny it.
如果你要引用 我会否认我说过

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,330
If you show someone the video of me saying it,
如果你给别人看我说这句话的录像

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I'll say that it's my cheesy twin brother who coined it.
我会说这是我的双胞胎兄弟

86
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,500
But it's true.
但确实是这样

87
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,340
We do do it better with pleasure if we pursue our passions.
如果我们热爱这项事业 就确实能把它做得更好

88
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,760
What happens in practice- again,there's a lot of research on it.
在实际生活中 同样也有很多关于这个的研究

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,300
You are reading some of it; I elaborate on some of it in the book
你们读到了一些 我把某些研究编进了书里

90
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,030
There's a lot of research that shows that
有很多研究显示

91
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,480
when we are engaged in a self-concordant goal,
当我们沉浸于自我和谐的目标时

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,360
we are much more likely
就会更倾向于

93
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,840
to then continue to pursue self-concordant goals.
继续追求其他自我和谐的目标

94
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,590
Because it was good that we were more successful;
因为这样很好 我们更成功了

95
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,450
we want more of it.It's self-reinforcing.
我们还不满足 这叫做自我强化

96
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,320
Not just on the macro level of life goals where it does that,
不仅是从生活目标的宏观角度来讲是这样

97
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,910
but also on the micro level.And what we see is a trickle effect.
微观角度也是这样 这其实是种涓滴效应

98
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,790
People who set self-concordant goals were actually doing better
制定了自我和谐目标的人其实

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,390
in areas that were not necessarily self-concordant.
在非自我和谐的方面也做得更好了

100
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,230
For instance-
打个比方

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,140
let's say you are a member of an undergrad A ccapella group.
比如说你是一个大学生合唱团的成员

102
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,220
And you really enjoy it.
你很喜欢这件事

103
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,940
In self-concordant,it's something that you believe in.
从自我和谐的角度来看 这是你所信仰的事

104
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,950
Something you enjoy.Something that is interesting to you.
是你喜欢的事 是你感兴趣的事

105
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,050
Something you are doing
是一件你正在做

106
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
because you are really want to be doing it.
因为你确实非常想做的事

107
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,980
In other words,a self-concordant goal that will have an effect,
换句话说 自我和谐的目标会对你生活的

108
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,040
a positive effect on other areas in your life-
其他方面产生积极影响

109
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,160
such as a class that you don't necessarily enjoy that much,
比如说一门你不那么喜欢的课

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,080
but you are doing more because you feel that you have to,
你去上课是因为你觉得你必须要去

111
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,140
as opposed to you really really want to.
而不是你真的非常想去

112
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,670
So potentially identifying self-concordant goals
因此找到自我和谐的目标

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,440
can also help you improve your grades.
其实可以帮助你提高成绩

114
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,360
Again,even though they are not related at all.
虽然它们似乎毫不相关

115
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,640
Because overall,you are more motivated; you are more excited;
因为总体来说 你更有动力了 你更兴奋了

116
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,490
you are more interested; and you enjoy life
你更感兴趣了 你用更积极的感情

117
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,050
as a whole more in positive emotions have a trickle effect.
来享受整个人生 这就是涓滴效应

118
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,020
In a way you can think about it like a candle in a dark room.
这个效应可以想象为黑暗房间里的蜡烛

119
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,260
Very often you don't need to light up the entire room with lights
通常你不需要将点很多灯照亮整个屋子

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,570
A single candle sometimes
有时只需一根蜡烛

121
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,160
is enough to spread the light to darkened corners of the room.
就足以将光明遍布房间每一个角落

122
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
The same with the self-concordant goals.
自我和谐的目标也是这样

123
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,520
They have a trickle effect.Choosing to do things-
它们具有涓滴效应

124
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,250
doing what we want to do has also health benefits.
选择做我们想做的事同样对健康也有好处

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,330
This is one of the most important studies done
这是心理学领域的重要研究之一

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,880
in the field of psychology by,once again,our own Ellen Langer.
同样是由我们学校的Ellen Langer做的研究

127
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,720
What she did was going into old age homes and divide it-
她所做的就是去了一个养老院

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,160
the old age home randomly into two groups.
将老人们随机分为两组

129
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,350
The one group got all the support that they needed-
第一组所有需要都能得到满足

130
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,000
whatever they wanted they got.
不管什么需要都能满足

131
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,730
They asked for certain food- they got it.
他们想吃什么 就能吃什么

132
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,940
They asked to be helped,carrying out certain tasks- they got it.
他们想在某些事情上寻求帮助 同样也能满足

133
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,530
Everything was done for them.
所有事情都无需他们动手

134
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,510
In many ways,the old age homes that many people dream of.
很大程度上来说 这是大多数人梦想的养老院

135
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,700
And then the second group didn't have as good.
而第二组就没有这么好的待遇了

136
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,430
Not everything was catered for them.
他们不能衣来伸手饭来张口

137
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,090
They very often had to do their own things.
时常都需要自己动手

138
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,930
For example,notably,they had to water their own plants.
比如说 他们必须自己浇花

139
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,610
They very often had to set their own routine during the day.
他们必须自己规划每天做的事

140
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,220
The service wasn't as great as the first group.
服务没有第一组那么周到

141
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,300
They had to tell the employees if they needed something.
他们需要什么的话 必须自己告诉职员

142
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
They very often had to get it themselves.
经常需要自己动手丰衣足食

143
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,880
And again,they planted- they watered their own plants.
同样 他们需要自己浇花

144
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,930
And what they did was-
而研究的内容是

145
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,960
Langer created this two different scenarios
Langer创造了这两种不同的情境

146
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,480
and then went back 18 months later.
然后一年半后再回来

147
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,210
After 18 months,the second group,
一年半后 第二组

148
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,330
the group that watered their plants,
自己浇花的那一组

149
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,520
the group that took care of their day,
自己照顾自己的那一组

150
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,720
the group that was not catered for,
没有人管顾的那一组

151
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,290
in the same way as the first group-
跟第一组相比起来

152
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,420
they were less likely to be depressed; they were happier;
他们没那么沮丧 他们更快乐

153
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,920
they were more energetic; more independent,physically healthier.
他们更有活力 更独立 也更健康

154
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,070
And the clincher:
更关键的是

155
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:48,000
18 months later,they were 50 percent more likely to be alive.
一年半后 他们活着的比例比另一组高出一半

156
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,270
The only difference being that group that was healthier,happier,
唯一的区别就在于更健康 更开心

157
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,450
more likely to be alive,had choice.
更高存活率的这组 有选择的权利

158
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,330
They did their own thing.
他们能做自己想做的事

159
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,310
They were asked what do you want to do,
他们会询问自己想做什么

160
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,310
as opposed to being catered for,being supported.
而不是衣来伸手饭来张口

161
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,100
And in some way,this was too easy.There was no choice involved.
从某种角度来说 这太轻松了 不需要做什么选择

162
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,280
And when we choose,when we do what we want to,
当我们能够选择时 当我们做自己想做的事时

163
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,630
it has implications to our well being,to our success,
是有益于我们的幸福 我们的成功

164
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,170
and to our physical health,

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,010
to the point of leading to longer life.
尤其是能使我们更加长寿

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,640
Significant difference with such little intervention.
小小的差异导致了巨大的区别

167
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,910
And yet,so many of the old age homes today are built
但今天的很多养老院依然是基于

168
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,510
around the notion of "let's catered to all their needs"-
"迎合老人所有的需要"

169
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,540
"let's do everything that they desire",
"满足他们所有需求"

170
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,680
"let's make it easy for them".That's not necessarily good.
"为他们提供方便"这样的理念上的 这其实不好

171
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,180
There's too easy-
太过于轻松了

172
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,520
whether it's the notion that I talked about in the book,
不管是我在书里提到的概念

173
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,850
"the underprivilege of the privilege",
"特权中的非特权"

174
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,580
or things are too easy,or we don't fail enough;
一切过于轻松 我们失败得不够

175
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,780
whether it is in the old age home,or it becomes too easy,
抑或是老人院里 一切过于轻松

176
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,640
as opposed to making choices and struggling and making decisions.
不需要做选择 无需挣扎 无需做决定

177
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,380
And it applies as we will see later also,
而且同样适用于我们之后会讲到的

178
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,640
to the notion of stress- and how important that can be
压力的概念 以及它对于

179
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,790
in cultivating resilience and ultimately,happiness.
培养耐性以及最终获得幸福的重要性

180
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,800
Too easy is not necessarily good.Finally,
过于轻松不一定是件好事

181
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,770
we see this also in oppressive regimes versus democracies.
最后我们看到压迫政权和民主之间也是这样

182
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,690
One of the main reasons why people are happier under democracies-
人们之所以在民主制度下更幸福的重要原因之一

183
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,740
and remember,that is one of few external circumstances
记住 这是少数可以预测幸福的

184
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,880
that can predict happiness-
外部条件之一

185
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,470
one of the reasons is because under democracies,people have choice.
原因之一就在于 民主制度下人们有选择的权利

186
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,660
As opposed to under dictatorships,
而在独裁政治下

187
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,900
very often they are told "OK,you need to go into accounting.
通常人们会被告知"好 你去做会计

188
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,890
You need to go into engineering.

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,280
And you need to go into athletics." And so on.
你去做运动员" 诸如此类

190
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,250
And when you have a choice,that is a good predictor of happiness
如果你有选择 那就是快乐的预示

191
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,340
Let's shift gear a little bit.
让我们稍微换一下话题

192
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm going to talk about something very much related
我要讲一些与自我和谐非常相关的东西

193
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,200
to self-concordance,but from a different angle.
但是是从不同的角度来讲的

194
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,470
I'm going to talk about values in action,or in short,the VIA.
我要讲讲行为价值观 缩写为VIA

195
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,500
Values in action,the VIA,is arguably the most ambitious,
行为价值观 VIA 可以说是积极心理学中

196
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,250
and certainly one of the most important projects
最有前景 也是

197
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,410
within positive psychology.
最重要的课题之一

198
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:45,920
It was initiated by Chris Peterson in the picture,
它最先是由图中的Chris Peterson

199
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,780
professor of University of Michigan and Martin Seligman.

201
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,230
is alternative to the DSM- the DSM,
可以代替DSM DSM就是

202
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,170
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder,which

203
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,660
is essentially the classification of all known mental disorders.
其中包括已知所有心理疾病的分类

204
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,990
It's a very thick book,a very important document where it says-
这是本非常厚的书 非常重要的文件 上面讲了

205
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,860
for example,it lists certain criteria

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,660
and it says if a person has seven of the ten of these criteria

207
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,250
for x period of time,that person has major depression.

Come along Seligman and Peterson right at the beginning
而Seligman和Peterson

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,850
when positive psychology came onto the scene and say,

it will identify individual strengths and virtues."

And they identified 24 character strengths,

221
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,520
all enlisted,explained,described in this book.

means of measuring these character strengths.
来测量这些人格力量

what are you good at; what are you passionate about.

230
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,670
The thing about character strengths-When they identified them,

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,720
they made sure that they identified universal characteristics.

In other words,it wasn't chosen by you know,

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,280
This was research done all over the world,
这是在全球范围进行的研究

235
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,170
cross-culturally to identify characters that are identical,

236
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,470
whether it was in United States or Europe,Asia- China,Japan

237
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,000
as well as the Massai tribe in Kenya

238
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,390
and the Inuits in Northern Greenland.
以及北格陵兰岛的因纽特人

239
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,770
So this was an international research project,
这是个全球范围的研究课题

240
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,470
because what they thought-
因为他们想

241
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,480
if we can find things that are common to all cultures,
如果我们能找到所有文化都共有的东西

242
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,970
we will identify what is the part of human nature,
就能找到人类本性的东西

243
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,090
as opposed to human nurture.

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,060
And they admit you know that this may change over time;
他们承认这是可以随时间变化的

245
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,380
we may become more sophisticated in measuring them.
在测量时我们可能会变得更老练

246
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,490
But as a start,the character strengths and virtues,
但作为开始 人格力量和美德

247
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,460
the values in action,manual and test,is an excellent start,
行为价值观 手册和测试 是一个好的开始

248
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,410
the one what you'll benefit from a great deal,

249
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,090
as you will see shortly.
很快你们就会明白

250
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,250
The key aspect also of these characteristics
这些特点的关键方面在于

251
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,600
is that they have moral value.
它们具有道德价值

252
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,980
For example,the ability to run fast-
例如跑得快的能力

253
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,280
it's certainly some people have this strength,
很显然有些人有这种能力

254
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,910
you know having more fast twitch than slow twitch,
身体各部位动得更快

255
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,190
having stronger muscles,for instance.
肌肉更强劲

256
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,740
It certainly is a strength,but it's not a character strength.
这是种力量 但不是人格力量

257
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,040
Because it doesn't in and of itself have a moral component.
因为它其中不含有道德成分

258
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,960
You could use your strength and your speed toward moral ends,
你可以将力量用于道德相关的事情

259
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,700
but in and of itself,
但就其本身来说

260
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,460
it has not been valued as a moral characteristic.
它并不算是一种道德特点

261
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,460
Similarly,in order for something to be a strength,
同理 一样东西要成为力量

262
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,780
it has to be used toward moral end.
就必须是用于道德方面的

263
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,650
For instance- as you'll see,
比方说

264
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,540
humor is one of the character strengths.However,
幽默是一种人格力量

265
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,100
if humor is used to hurt other people as it sometimes is,
但如果幽默被用来伤害他人

266
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,150
it cannot be considered a strength.
它就不能算作一种力量

267
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,680
So it's used toward moral noble ends.
所以它必须是用于道德高尚的方面

268
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,960
What values in action are in many ways-
行为价值观很大程度上是

269
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,170
they are about self-concordant journey.Meaning:
关于自我和谐的过程的 意思是

270
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,500
when we set a goal and outcome,we are about a destination-
当我们制定了目标和结果 有一个目的地

271
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,040
yes,it certainly benefits the journey.
对 这当然是对整个过程有益的

272
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,700
Yes,it certainly helps us enjoy by liberating us-
它通过解放我们来帮助我们

273
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,640
helps us enjoy the here and now.
享受现在 享受当下

274
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,830
But ultimately,what our focus is on- the end result.
但最终我们关注的是结果

275
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,400
With values in action,
有了行为价值观

276

our focus is on specifically,directly the journey.
我们就能直接关注这个过程

277
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,140
How can I enjoy getting to the end,my destination?
我如何能到达终点 我的目的地

278
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,350
Is it by engaging in a lot of learning?
是通过大量的学习吗

279
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,300
Is it by- which may be a character strength of mine,
是通过我可能拥有的人格力量之一

280
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,580
love of learning? Is it by engaging leading other people-
对学习的热爱吗 还是通过领导他人呢

281
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,380
the leadership is one of those character strengths?
领导也是人格力量之一

282
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,710
Is it by being spiritual and praying along the path-
是通过精神上的祈祷吗

283
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,840
if spirituality or awe is my character strengths.
如果信仰和敬畏是我的人格力量的话

284
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,720
So it's helping us enjoy the journey
它们能帮助我们享受

285
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,820
on the way to a destination we deem valuable.
前往我们认为有价值的目的地的过程

286
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,600
In other words,
换句话说

287
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,230
if we have a self-concordant end and a self-concordant journey,

And that's why it goes hand in hand with a self-concordant goal.

292
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,160
It's not that the self-concordant goals

However,what was found in the research is that

It also helps us build capacity

with the hardships when these inevitably arise.

the first step is to identify your character strengths.
第一步是找到你的人格力量

413
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Seems pretty obvious.
显而易见的

414
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,290
The way to do it- two steps,two sub-steps.
而找到力量的方法 又分为两步

415
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,470
First,to take the questionnaire,to take the test.
首先 做问卷 做测试

416
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,740
This is the website.It will all be emailed to you plus.
这就是那个网站 我会将它发给你们

And there are no right or wrong answers.

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,350
It's not like "it's better to have awe in your top five

421
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,200
and not so great to have prudence as your top one",
最好不要把审慎列为第一"之类的

422
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,520
which by the way is my top value.
顺便说一句 我把审慎列为第一

423
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,210
There's no good,bad.It's identifying who you are.
没有好或者不好 只是识别出你是谁

424
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,010
And all of them,again,we all have all 24.
它们所有 我们都有24个

425
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,800
You know,I think gratitude is my 19th.
感激是排在我的第19位的

426
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,120
Now does that mean that I don't enjoy being grateful,

427
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,010
that the gratitude exercise that I do every day

428
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,660
is not beneficial to me? Of course it is!
都是没有好处的呢 当然不是

429
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,720
But much higher for me is the love of learning.

And I said "well that made a lot of sense."

And when I am teaching the same course,

it's mostly impossible to experience a sense of calling

You know,for example,teaching is my calling.

I certainly experience a sense of calling-

there are elements of teaching that I don't enjoy it as much.

going over my lecture notes five times before each lecture.

you know second and third it gets a little bit repetitive.

But I know if I want to produce a good and effective lecture-

when I go over it once or twice versus five times.

638
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,650

it is a chore,something that I have to do.

640

However,remember the trickle effect.

641
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,760
Because overall,there's a sense of calling.

642
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,660
Overall,it's a self-concordant goal as well as journey.

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,890
Even those parts are OK,not that bad.
所以即使备五遍课也没问题 也没那么糟

644
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,010
Or let's say you really enjoy a certain course.
或者比方说你很喜欢一门课

645
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,050
Let's take a hypothetical example,1504.

646
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,670

you happen to have a midterm in a week.

You know,you may not enjoy every step of the way.

649
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,660
You know going over the material

650
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,450
for the second time or third time.
或者看三遍

651
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,600
However,if overall that experience is self-concordant,
但如果整体来说这件事是自我和谐的

652
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,670
important to you,and you enjoy it,
对你来说很重要 你很喜欢

653
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,940
even that part will not be that bad.It will be OK,
那么那样也就没那么糟糕 是可以接受的

654
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,160
especially if you start seeing that during that process,
尤其是当你发现在这个过程中

655
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,990
you'll begin to make new connections,

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,610
understand things,important things about yourself.
理解了你觉得很重要的知识

657
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,760
Important thing also to keep in mind about calling is that
关于使命同样要记住的一点是

658
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,370
well it does depend to some extent
它确实从某种程度上取决于

659
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,220
on the kind of work that you do.
你工作的种类

660
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,890
It depends much more on your perception of the work.
但更取决于你对工作的理解

661
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,910
So the research that I talk about in the book
我在书里讲到的研究

662
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,420
is about cleaners in a hospital
是关于医院里的清洁工的

00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,340
who were able to see their work as a calling.
他们将他们的工作视为使命

664
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,120
Why? Because they interpret their work not as
为什么 因为他们不是将工作诠释成

665
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,140
"I have to pick up the garbage and clean the toilet"-
"我必须清扫垃圾 打扫厕所"

666
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,670
which they actually had to do,but more as
虽然这是他们实际的工作 而是

00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,820
"I'm taking care of these patients; because without my work,

without me doing the excellent work,there'll be more pollution

And interestingly,many doctors from this same hospital

676
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,820
perceive their work as a job.
将他们的工作仅仅视为工作

677
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,010
Now you are more likely,again- not good,not bad it is-
你会更容易 同样没有好坏之分

678
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,560
you are more likely to find a sense of calling in your work

680
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,860

681
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,650
However,that does not mean that the person

who cleans the hospital cannot find the calling

00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,450

And the examples that Wrzesniewski talks about in the research

are things such as comparing between cleaners and other cleaners,

Or engineers.Some just see their work-

"OK.I have to do this.That's all I think about."
"好吧 这是我不得不做的事 就这样吧"

693

Versus thinking about a bigger picture.
有的则从更大的角度来考虑

我不是无足轻重的 我是一个很重要的项目的一部分

695
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,730
We can perceive almost any work

I know many of you are going into investment banking.

One of the ways to perceive investment banking is

700
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,240

And I'm going to have a great life style."
过上舒适的生活"

702
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,950
And that is an important motivation.Again,

people aren't and shouldn't be impervious to material comfort.
人们不应该完全抵制物质上的舒适

704
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,180
That's OK.However,people who only look at that,who only look-
没有关系 然而仅仅这样只看到这个的人

705
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,180
"OK.It's going to give me a great life style.
"这能让我过上很好的生活

709
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,290
Again,human nature.These needs- it's fine.
这是人性 这些需求都是正常的

710
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,440
But people who just look at these things will not be happy,
但仅仅看到这些的人不会快乐

711
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,730
or will not live up to their potential happiness in the long run.
或者不会长期地快乐

712
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,420
However,if I look at investment banking as that

713
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:48,850
and also an opportunity to create jobs which it does do-

is some thing that psychologists did not see before,
