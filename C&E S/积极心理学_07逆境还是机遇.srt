We ended by talking about Rena and other things.
我们讲到Rena和其他的一些事

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,080

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,880
where after a failure or a success there is a spike up,
成功或失败过后 会有大起大落

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,760
spike down,but then we recover.
但我们会恢复过来

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,700
And we basically move along a base level of well being
我们一生基本沿基准的幸福发展

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,090
through out our lives,with the ups and downs,the vicissitudes.
其中有起伏和变迁

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,650
The question then became,
所以问题是

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,470
or rather there was good news and bad news.
或说有好消息也有坏消息

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,350
The good news was,we don't really need to worry that much,
好消息是 我们不必太过担心

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,280
we can take more risks,we can put ourselves on the line more.
我们能冒更多风险 也更容易回到基准线上

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,840
Failure usually,not all failures,
失败往往 虽然不是所有的失败

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,310
but usually is just a temporary decline in our wellbeing level,
往往只是使幸福水平暂时的下降

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,870
self esteem level,and then every quickly we jump up again.
还有自尊水平 然后会迅速回升

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,080
So that's the good news.
所以这是好消息

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,880
The bad news is: if we're just around the same base level,
坏消息是 如果我们总是回到原来的水平

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,080
you know,why should we put any effort into our wellbeing?
那我们为什么要努力寻求幸福呢?

23
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,080
And the answer to that,
而答案

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,520
and the whole course essentially is an answer to that.
这整个课程本质上就是对它进行回答

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,230
How can we raise that base level?
我们如何提升基准水平?

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,940
One of the things is coping,putting ourselves on the line.
一个方法是去面对 把自己置于风险之上

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,250
And the reason why coping,
我们这么做的原因

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,330
why putting ourselves on the line yields positive
是因为这样能产生积极的影响

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,540
results in terms of the base level of wellbeing going up,
结果 幸福基准会上升

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,930
meaning still the ups and downs,
意思是仍然有起有落

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,870
but ups and downs looking this way
但起伏是像这样斜线上升的

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,840
as opposed to around a straight line
而不是在一条直线上或者

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,220
or a parallel line is that when we cope,we see ourselves coping,
平行线上徘徊 我们去面对时能想象我们的行动

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,110
we see ourselves trying and through self perception theory,
想象自己在努力 通过自我知觉理论

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,150
we derive certain conclusions about ourselves:
我们对自己做某种总结

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,010
oh,I must be courageous;
我一定很勇敢

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,170
oh,I must be a person who has high self esteem;

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,810
and so on and so on.
等等

40
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,280
And then we derive conclusions about ourselves in the same way
然后我们给自己做出的结论

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,260
that we derive conclusions about other people.
就像我们给他人的结论一样

42
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,540
That is self-perception theory.
这就是自我知觉理论

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,040
The second reason is that once we started failing more often,
第二个原因是一旦我们经常经历失败

44
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,160
we realized that actually it's not that bad,
我们会意识到那其实并不那么糟糕

45
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,960
it's not what we make it out to be.
不像我们想象的那么糟

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,750
The pain that in our minds we associate with failure
我们脑中想象的失败的痛苦

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,420
is far greater that the actual pain of failure when that comes.
比实际的痛苦要多得多

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,410
Maybe not initially when it happens,but after a while;
也许不是即时的 而是稍后才感受到

49
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,250
and then we recover again,and we see,oh,I can deal with it,
当我们恢复后 就知道我能应付它

50
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,270
I must be a person with resilience.
我一定是一个有适应力的人

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,130
And finally,there is more success as a result of coping.
最终 努力去面对后会有更多成功

52
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,650
Learn to fail,or fail to learn,
学习失败 或在失败中学习

53
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,030
there is no other way to succeed.
成功没有其他途径

54
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,060
So what I want to move on to now and just finish up on
我现在要说的是

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,080
is how do we become more of an optimistic.
我们如何变得更乐观

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,090
So we talked about the virtues,we talked about longevity,
我们谈过优点 谈过长寿

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,540
people who are optimistic actually live longer.
乐观的人实际上活得更久

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,630
We talked about higher levels of success,

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,080

are eight times less likely to be depressed;

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,250
they are much more likely to be happy.
他们会更快乐

63
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,770
And again,optimism as an interpretation style,
再说一遍 乐观是指诠释的方式

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,730
not as a Pollyannaish feel-good kind of approach.
而不是盲目地自我感觉良好的方式

65
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,000
So how do we become more of an optimism?
我们如何变得更加乐观?

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,080
I want to talk about three techniques.

First is to take action,to just do it,

especially athletes as,as a technique.

this is based on research by Albert Bendura,

you'll read about self-efficacy,

Because hard work and coping inevitably leads to success,

more success at least than we had before,

when we didn't act and we didn't cope.
以前不行动 不去面对时要成功

117
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,540
So even if it's a little bit,in and of itself contributes,
即使只是一点点成功的贡献

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,330
that success contributes to our self-efficacy,

the five year old could draw that model.

126
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,080
do we just tell students constantly you're terrific,

you're wonderful,you're great,or do we like Marva Collins,

make them actually work hard so that they succeed more,

coping and failing,and getting up again.

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,110
It works also in a similar way to our physical immune system.
它和我们身体免疫系统运作方式相同

134
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,880
You know when we get sick,when we get ill,

our body sense anti-bodies

137
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,720
So our body become immunize through failure.
我们的身体通过失败获得免疫力

138
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,030
Same on the psychological level,failure is underrated.

139
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,030
You know one of the things that I wish for you,

and I mean it genuinely.

I'm not saying it ingest,I really do.
我不是随便说说 我真这么想的

143
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,180
And,coupled with that,I hope that when you fail,

144
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,270
you will also learn to interpret it in a different way
你们也能学习用不同的方式去诠释

145
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,840
than most of us usually interpret failure.

that I'm creating a simulator for my mind.

we can do exactly the same thing through the simulator.

in the real thing and the imaginary thing.

whether is in our imagination or in a speech to the nation

437
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,200

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,420
Cognitive therapy has been used very successfully over the last,

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,690
over forty years,Martin Seligman was one of the founders

440
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,820

He studied with,with Beck,

who was the official founder of this technique in this approach.
Beck是这技巧的正式创始人

443
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,410
And what cognitive therapy is about is the following.
认知疗法的内容如下

444
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,850
Its basic premise is that thoughts drive emotion.
它的基本前提是思想驱动情感

445
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:36,710
So for example: there is an external event.
比如 外部发生一件事

446
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,860
I perceive that event,
我感知到那件事

447
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,690
and what I do then after I perceive that event,
我感知那件事后的行动是

448
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,790
there is evaluation of that event,
对那事进行评估

449
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,380
in other words,a thought about that event.
也就是对那件事进行思考

450
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:08,060
And then,as a result of that thought,that evokes an emotion.
思考后就唤起了情感

451
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,360
So for example,an event,a lion is running toward me,
比如 事件 有只狮子向我奔来

452
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,500
my evaluation: oh my god,he's gonna eat me.
我的评估 天 它要吃掉我

453
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,400
The emotion: fear,and that of course leads to motion,
引发的情感是恐惧 然后自然就导致行动

454
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,260
run away or stand up bravely and fight the lion.
逃跑或勇敢地和狮子搏斗

455
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,240
Or,another one: I see an event,

456
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,300
a gorgeous woman walking down the street,my evaluation:

oh,it's my gorgeous wife,and the emotion:love.

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,190
Event,evaluation,thought,emotion,

459
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,580
and then that leads to action.
然后导致行动

460
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,920
What cognitive therapy says is that if we want to change emotions
认知疗法认为如果我们想改变情感

461
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,620
whether it's of depression,whether it's of anxiety,

462
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,750
where we need to intervene is here,

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,950
is that the level of evaluation and the level of thought.

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,970
And if we can change that,we also change our emotion.

465
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,050
Specifically,what cognitive therapy saying is that

we need to restore sense of rationality,

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,390
we need to restore the real,it's certainly not saying,

468
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,640
let's say I have a,you know,

a very important try out coming up and I get nervous.

Cognitive therapy is not saying stop feeling nervous,

let's change your evaluation or your thoughts,

what it is saying is that sometimes our thoughts are irrational,
它说的是我们的想法有时是荒谬的

476
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,940
and we'll mention that last time,for example,

or the fact that I will never succeed in tests again.

It was just once,it was temporary,

485
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,060
and that led to difficult emotions such as resignation:

486
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,990
nobody will ever want me again.
没人会再需要我了

487
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,650
And what cognitive therapy does is just restore

00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,900
that rationality by saying: yeah,it hurts,it's tough,

when it comes to extreme cases of psychopathology,

The five-year Cambridge Somerville study that failed.

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,580
That doesn't mean its easy,

the next ten minutes I'm gonna describe some of the ideas

518
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,830
next two classes,but you need to do more than that.

519
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,660
So let me share with you a summary of cognitive therapy
我给你们讲下认知疗法的概要

520

and this...the 3Ms is my acronym.
这三个M是首字母缩写

521
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,050
And what I did there was to put together essentially the work
我所做的是从本质上把

522
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,180
of Karen Reivich whom I just mentioned,
我刚提到的Karen Reivich的成果

523
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,680
the work of Martin Seligman,
Martin Seligman的成果

524
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,020
the work of Aaron Beck Seligman's teacher
Seligman的老师Aaron Beck的成果

525
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,870
and the work of David Burns. Some of you may heard of him,
还有David Burns的成果 你们也许有人知道他

526
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,310
The Feeling Good Handbook,who is also a student of Aaron Beck.
《好心情手册》的作者 也是Aaron Beck的学生

527
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,290
So this is putting together their work
把他们的成果结合起来

528
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,070
into 3Ms subdivided each into 2 suggestions.
成为三个M 每个M有二个建议

529
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,010
They're inter connected as you'll see.
你们会看到它们互相有联系

530
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,050
It's not a very clear distinction. However what you'll notice is
区别不怎么明显 但你们会注意到

531
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,720
you could usually relate to one or two of the 3Ms.
你们总能联系上三M中的一两个

532
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,630
Things that you do yourself. So beyond the lookout ask yourself:
在你们行动之前先问自己

533
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,010
"Where do I distort the reality?
“我在哪处扭曲了事实?

534
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,610
Where do I have distortion in terms of evaluation?
我在评估方面 或者

535
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,230
In terms of my thought?"
想法方面哪里歪曲了事实?”

536
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,850
That lead to certain negative emotions that are unnecessary,
导致了某些不必要的消极情绪

537
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,270
because if I restore rationality
因为如果我恢复理性

538
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,020
I will not feel the same emotion to the same degree.
我就感觉不到同样程度的情感

539
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,140
So ask yourself when you look through the 3Ms.
所以当你们学习三个M的时候问自己

540
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,920
The 3Ms...essentially the 3 traps of irrational thoughts.
三个M指的是非理性想法的三个陷阱

541
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,440
The first one is magnifying.
第一个是放大

542
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,060
It's exaggerating something that happens. For example,
就是夸大发生的事情 比如

543
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,670
you know induction is something very natural.
归纳法是天生的本能

544
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,410
A kid sees this and will call it a stool
一个孩子看到这个 会叫它凳子

545
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,390
and then they see another stool in the bar
然后他们在酒吧看到另一张凳子

546
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,840
when they go out at the age of one
当他们一岁时出去

547
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,860
and then they see another stool. After they see 20 stools
再看到另一张凳子 看过20张凳子后

548
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,160
they begin to form a concept they induce that this is a stool.
开始形成一个观念 认为这东西就是凳子

549
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,500
And now they see one even one
现在他们看到一张

550
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,050
that they have never seen before they know what it is.
以前从没见过的凳子 他们也知道是它什么

551
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,330
Just like I see a person in the street
就像我看见一个人在街上

552
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,910
whom I never encounter before I know this is a person,
以前从没见过他 我知道这是个人

553
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,860
because I induce from all the other events
因为我从其他发生过的事件中

554
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,900
that happened before that this is also a person.
归纳出这个也是一个人

555
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,270
So that's induction. That's healthy. That's important.
这就是归纳法 是健康的 重要的

556
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,420
That's how we develop concepts and language.
我们就是这样形成观念和语言的

557
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,750
But sometimes we take this too far and we over generalize.
但有时我们做得过头 归纳过度了

558
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,670
Once again,I did poorly on the midterm...conclusion,
比如 我期中考成绩很差

559
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,510
generalization: I'm just not smart. I just can't succeed.
归纳为 我不聪明 我不能成功

560
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:46,090
Here is a student. Over generalization,the evaluation,
这个学生就是归纳过度了 他的评估

561
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,400
the thought,irrational.
他的想法是非理性的

562
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:57,970
Or he just said no to me. Everyone is gonna say no.
或他拒绝了我 因此大家都会拒绝我

563
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,990
instead of being realistic and saying,"wow,just look around.
而不是实事求是地说 "看看周围

564
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,960
There are so many wonderful and sensitive and caring men in 1504"
1504课堂上还有有很多帅哥"

565
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,940
So,another thing this is something we'll talk about a lot...
另一件事我们经常讨论的是

566
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,940
the All or Nothing approach. The All or Nothing...
全有或全无态度

567
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,720
we'll talk about it when we talk about perfectionism.
我们会在讲完美主义时讨论它

568
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,850
It's catastrophizing failure,
它是把失败小题大做

569
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,490
not seeing failure as an opportunity,
而不是把失败当做一次机遇

570
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,420
as a stepping stone but seeing it as the end of the world.
一个跳板 而是视之为世界末日

571
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,280
I got a B as a freshman. Now I'm going to be homeless.
我大一时得了B 现在要无家可归了

572
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,330
Not finding a job ever. All or Nothing.
永远找不到工作 全有或全无

573
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,150
Either straight As or complete failure.
要么全是A 要么就是彻底的失败

574
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,230
We'll talk about that a lot.
我们会多次提及它

575
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,050
Because it's one of the key elements that prevents us from coping
因为这是阻止我们去面对的一个关键要素

576
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,880
from putting ourselves on the line.
阻止我们投入进去

577
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,930
The other side of it,
它的另一面

578
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,980
which is actually other side of the same coin is minimizing.
同一个硬币的另一面 是极小化

579
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,560
This is something I do very often.
这是我经常做的

580
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,230
This is my trap that I still have to be aware of,
这是我仍要警惕的陷阱

581
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,090
I still think about today,
我至今仍会考虑

582
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,520
even though I became aware of it years ago.
虽然我几年前就注意到它了

583
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,490
Only now I catch myself doing it much promptly.
直到现在我才能够迅速醒觉自己在这么做

584
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,700
So the first idea of minimizing is
极小化的第一个概念是

585
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,410
what Karen Reivich calls tunnel vision.
Karen Reivich称之为“隧道视野”

586
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:28,310
For example,let's say I have 620 students in my class.
比如 我的课堂里有620个学生

587
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:38,650
And out of these 620 students 618 are engaged in the material.
620个中618个在看教材

588
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,860
One is looking at the ceiling,at the lights.
一个在看天花板 在看灯

589
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,820
And another one,out of the 620 students,is asleep.
620个中的另外一个在睡觉

590
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,000
Tunnel Vision is when I focus on that one person who is asleep.
隧道视野指的是当我关注那个睡觉的人

591
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,000
And I say to myself,
对自己说

592
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,260
" Wow,I'm giving boring,sleep inducing lectures."
“我的课肯定讲得让人无聊 犯困”

593
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:08,670
Or the other way around: I have 620 students,618 are asleep.
或反过来 620个学生中618个睡着

594
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,380
One is looking around. And one is going "wow!"
一个在开小差 一个听得十分入迷

595
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,210
and I only focus on that person and I say I'm a great lecturer.
我只关注那个人 我说我是个好讲师

596
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,370
I'm so inspiring.
我非常受鼓舞

597
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,940
Again,it's unrealistic. One way or the other. And
然而不管怎样这都是不现实的

598
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,370
what cognitive therapy does is bring realism into the equation.
认知疗法把现实主义引入这个等式

599
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,980
Again this is something I often fall into.
我也经常因此而困扰

600
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,580
And just recently I fell into this. And it happened...
我最近刚遇到这个情况

601
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,060
I know many of you saw the Jon Stewart show.
你们许多人看过Jon Stewart脱口秀

602
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,250
So what happened in the Jon Stewart show...he was so fast,
在Jon Stewart脱口秀中 他讲得太快

603
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,080
way too fast for me...I felt like I was 2 questions behind
对我而言超级快 我感觉就像落后了两拍

604
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,900
still contemplating and thinking and saying
还在深思和考虑着两个之前的问题

605
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,360
"well,this could be interesting research."
“这会是个很有趣的研究”

606
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,550
And Jon was...he was already 10 steps ahead.
而Jon已经领先了10步

607
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,840
So I fell behind and I felt slow.
我落后了 感觉很迟钝

608
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,430
And I also said something that I later regretted.
我也说了些后来让自己后悔的话

609
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,170
It was just one sentence.
只是一句话

610
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,690
No big deal. But that is what I focus on.
没什么大不了的 但我专注在这上面

611
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,460
You know I flew home after. I went back to Israel.
我后来飞回家 飞回以色列

612
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,640
The whole flight that what I was thinking of.
在飞机上我一直在想这事

613
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,370
Ignoring the other things.
忽略了其他的事情

614
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,090
You know the fact that 2 hours after the Jon Stewart show,
Jon Stewart脱口秀完了后二小时

615
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,380
the book became a best seller. Completely ignore that.
这本书成了最畅销书 我完全忽略了这个

616
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,060
Didn't exist as far as I was concerned.
我根本没去考虑那

617
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,460
It was just that one sentence. How could I say it?
我一直在想那句话 我怎么会说出来的?

618
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,930
Why didn't I prepare for it better? And so on.
为什么没有更好的准备? 等等

619
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,850
And then I suddenly said," Hey,wait a minute!" Tunnel Vision.
然后我突然说"等一下" 隧道视野

620
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,210
And I zoomed out. I looked at the bigger picture.
我把它缩小了 我把视野扩大

621
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,620
Then I said,"okay,so I said something that I regret. Big deal."
然后我说”我说了一句让我后悔的话 超赞啊”

622
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,820
You know. It's comedy. It's fun. So many people,
这是喜剧 很有趣 许多人在看

623
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,150
so many of your friends have watched and enjoyed it.
你的许多朋友都看过 都很喜欢

624
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,740
It was a great opportunity. I looked at the bigger picture.
这是个很好的机会 我看到了更大的方面

625
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,340
Gave myself the permission to be human.
允许自己做回一个人

626
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,460
To regret it.But then overall,
会感到后悔 但从总体上

627
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,230
I could see it in a much more rational light than before.
我能用比以前更理性的目光看待它

628
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,840
Big dealSo again,as I said,I still apply...I still use these ideas.
像我说的 我仍然在用这些想法

629
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,660
In the past,
过去

630
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,360
it would take me months to get over this one sentence.
我可能要花几个月才不会想这句话

631
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,990
Whereas now,zoom out. Evaluation thought,irrational.
但是现在 视野变窄 评估想法 非理性的影响

632
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,280
And recover much more promptly.
能更迅速地恢复

633
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,220
Dismissal of positives or negatives. So the person
消除积极或者消极的影响

634
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,140
who has tunnel vision doesn't see the other 618 people
有隧道视野的人不会去留意其他618个

635
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,850
who are engaged or asleep.
专心听课或睡觉的人

636
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,200
The person who dismiss the positives see those
忽视了积极面的人看到那些

637
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,810
but says they're unimportant; they are trivial in comparison to
但说他们不重要 它们很微不足道

638
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,910
how I just failed or what I just did wrong. So for example,
比起我的失败或我做的错事 比如

639
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,680
and this again,something that I...a trap that I often fall into.
我经常会遇到的一个困境

640
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,890
When I was a senior,I applied for fellowships
我大四时申请了奖学金

641
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,230
and I got a fellowship to go to Cambridge.
我得到去剑桥的奖学金

642
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,280
And I got the John Elliot Fellowship.
我得的是John Elliot奖学金

643
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,600
And there are 4 fellowships that go to Cambridge:
剑桥有四个奖学金

644
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,710
the John Elliot,the Fiske,um...one other...Pembroke;
John Elliot和Fiske 还有Pembroke

645
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,240
then there is the John Harvard fellowship.
还有一个是John Harvard奖学金

646
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,350
So I got the John Elliot,one of the 4.
我得到了John Elliot奖学金 四个之一

647
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,920
Immediately when I got it,I know that I got it obviously.
我得到后不久 我就得到消息了

648
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,750
It wasn't that I was ignoring it.
并不是我无视了它

649
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,010
But then I said why didn't I get the John Harvard fellowship.
但我想为什么没能得到John Harvard奖学金

650
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,620
Now there is no difference between them except for the names.
它们之间除名字不同外没任何区别

651
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,530
But that's immediately what my mind went to. And that,
但那是我的脑袋里立刻想到的

652
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,630
that was very important experience for me because I said
对我而言是很重要的经历 因为我说

653
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,230
"wow,look at you. "and that's when I started to recognize
“看看你” 我在那个时候开始意识到

654
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,280
the importance and the power of our evaluation.
我们的评估的重要性和威力

655
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,410
And how that can determine or even ruin
它是怎样决定或甚至毁掉

656
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,300
what should have been a celebration.
本该是一件值得庆祝的事

657
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,110
But once we recognize it,once we understand it,
但一旦我们认识它 一旦了解它后

658
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,270
we can dispute it. We can challenge it.
我们可以怀疑它 可以质疑它

659
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,340
We can reframe it and see the positive as well.
可以重组它 也能看到积极的一面

660
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,490
Again,all it's saying in cognitive therapy is let's be real.
此外 认知疗法就是要我们实际点

661
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,400
Making up or fabricating the 3rd M.
第三个M是虚构 或称捏造

662
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,960
This is when we create something ex nihilo,from nothing.
这是我们无中生有的时候

663
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,570
So for example,we personalize it or we blame.
比如 我们个人化或者归咎他人

664
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,830
We see this very often with people who are abused.
被虐待的人身上经常能看到这点

665
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,480
So an abused wife will very often say
受虐待的妻子经常会说

666
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,100
"It's my doing. It's my fault. I'm not behaving appropriately."
“是我做的 我的错 我做的不对”

667
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,820
Instead of rationally saying
而不是理智地说

668
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,880
"This guy is abusive. I'm out of here."
“这个家伙虐待我 我要离开”

669
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,160
That's irrational personalization.
那是不理性地个人化

670
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,990
It can also be the other way around.
它也会有别的方式

671
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,190
You know,I just did poorly on an exam
我有次考试成绩很差

672
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,700
and I blame my boyfriend or girlfriend for it.
我因此责怪我男朋友或女朋友

673
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,060
That's also unrealistic. I need to take responsibility.
那也是不现实的 我得承担责任

674
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,310
You got to remember Nathaniel Branden. No one is coming.
要记住Nathaniel Branden的例子 没有人会来

675
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,440
Take responsibility rather than blame.
承担起责任而不是责备别人

676
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,660
One of the key ideas (that)
Marva Collins和她的学生交流的

677
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,010
Marva Collins communicates to her students.
重要的观点之一

678
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,760
So again,it's not going to the personalizing...over-personalizing
不是过度个人化

679
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,970
or over-blaming,it's being real.
或过度责备 而是面对现实

680
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,410
And finally,emotional reasoning.
最后是情感的推理

681
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,210
I am envious; therefore I must be a bad person.
我满怀妒嫉 因此我肯定是个坏人

682
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,500
Or I'm experiencing danger
或我在试镜前

683
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,130
before a tryout therefore it must be dangerous.
遇到了危险 所以肯定很危险

684
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,150
Taking an emotion and making it into reality
选取一种情绪 让它成为现实

685
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,550
whereas instead of understanding an emotion is an emotion,
而不是把情感只当做情感

686
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,710
it doesn't necessary capture reality,
不必符合现实

687
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,140
it is my evaluation of reality.
而是我对现实的评估

688
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:47,860
Or,I'm extremely scared of failing...and therefore...
或者 我非常害怕失败 因此

689
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,840
it means that failing it's really dangerous,
意味着失败是很危险的

690
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,620
while in fact it's not. I'll get back up again very quickly,
实际不是的 我会马上回到这个话题

691
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,650
so it's having the correct evaluation,
所以要有正确的评估

692
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,970
correcting for the track,correcting for these errors.
更正轨迹 更正这些错误

693
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,990
Or feeling that,
更正"我很平庸

694
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,280
I'm second-rate and I'm no good in psychology or maths,
心理学或数学我学不好"之类的想法

695
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,320
and because I feel that,my evaluation of it is,well,
因为我有那种感觉 我的评估就是

696
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,820
I must really be second-rate and no good,
我肯定真的很平庸 学不好

697
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,920
instead having the rational belief of,well,let me try out,
而不是理性的想法 让我试一下

698
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,020
let me see how things go,correcting the distortions.
看看事情会怎么样 更正扭曲的想法

699
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,810
The key,once again,is to get real.
再说一次 关键是真实化

700
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,880
How do we get real through the questions that we ask?
我们如何通过我们的提问变真实?

701
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,700
I am going to give you just a few examples here;
我在这要给你们举几个例子

702
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,660
you are going to practice with those on your own.
你们要自己去练习

703
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,550
But here are just some of them.
这些是其中几个

704
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,780
First of all,is my conclusion tied to reality?
首先 我的结论和现实相关吗?

705
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,190
Second,is it rational? They are interconnected.
第二 那合理吗? 它们是相关联的

706
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,350
Am I ignoring something important?
我忽略了什么重要的事吗?

707
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,990
Like the fact that---you know the book did well afterwards---
比如 之后那本书销量很好

708
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:07,970
like the fact that there are other cool guys in 1504,and so on.
比如1504教室还有别的男孩 等等

709
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,520
What important evidence
什么重要的迹象

710
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,830
do I still need to take into consideration?
是我需要考虑的?

711
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,540

我们将在这里讨论

884
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,000
that I would like to discuss here,
本质上来说有两种原型

885
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,640
two archetypes that capture in many ways

how we can cognitively reconstruct,enhance,create our reality.

893
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,890
Now,we all exist on the continuum of

898
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:18,050
What I'm going to argue for is to move a little bit more

from the fault-finding toward the benefit-finding,

because there are many benefits to it that I'll discuss later.

00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,020
I got the name from the work of Henry David Thoreau,

903
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,770
the fault-finder will find faults even in paradise.

they begin to believe that no matter what they do,

And they resigned to the reality

00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,100
and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy of course,
那同时当然也让他们的存在

919
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,500
their existence.
变成自我实现预言

920
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:37,410
A fault-finder makes lemonade out of lemons,

00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,920

The benefit-finder finds the miracle in the common,

931
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,930

00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,840
the benefit-finder may be detached,

933
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,190
this is one of the criticisms of people who always see,

you know,the bright side of life,

935
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,250
and that is the problem if that is the case. Again,
这样的话的确是一个问题

936
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,910
this class is not advocating focusing only on the positive;
这节课不提倡只专注积极面

937
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,420
its focus is advocating reality.
它专注于提倡现实

00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:00,390
And reality comprises both good and bad,
现实包含好的和坏的食物

00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,570
reality comprises both geometric shapes

the detached benefit-finder is certainly not an archetype

that I would advocate nor would it lead to mental health

in the long run.

00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,050
however,we are co-creator.

"Now however fixed these elements of reality may be,

we still have a certain freedom in our dealings with them.

THAT they are is undoubtedly beyond our control;
感觉的存在 我们虽不能控制

00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:55,050
but WHICH we attend to,note,and
但是在我们的结论里 我们注意哪个

955
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,430
make emphatic in our conclusions depends on our own interests;
着重哪个 毕竟得凭我们个人的利益来决定

956
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,620
and,according as we lay the emphasis here or there,
着重之点不同

957
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,550
quite different formulations of truth result.
结果构成的真理可完全不同

958
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,590
We read the same facts differently.
事实全同 我们的看法可各异

959
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,680
'Waterloo',with the same fixed details,

960
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,780
spells a 'victory' for an Englishman;

for a Frenchman it spells 'defeat'.
法国人看来是"失败"

962
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:20,270
So,for an optimist philosopher the universe spells victory,
同样 宇宙也如此 乐观主义者看作是胜利

00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,870
for a pessimist,defeat. What we say about reality thus
悲观主义者看作是失败 我们对现实抱有怎样说法

964
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,730
depends on the perspective into which we throw it. "
全看我们怎么给他配景"

965
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,000
William James said these back in 1890,

981
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,960
And very often it is up to us,as we co-create our reality.

982
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,850
The stone is there,we are not responsible for it;
