When we go to sleep,when we are tired?

it's like a business person going making a deal and saying,
就像是商人去谈生意说

"well I can't afford spending 100,000 dollars on this deal."

105
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,500

106
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,660
Then it changes.
这就不一样了

107
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,970
And yeah,maybe I can afford 100,000 if there is ROI-
也许我可以负担得起10万

108
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,000

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,990
The same with sleep.

and why we need to make it a priority.

113
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,390
So let me just list a few very briefly.

First of all,physical immune system strengthens significantly.

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,650
I mean we all know when we are,when we go on little sleep,
我是说 我们都知道当我们睡得很少

116
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,630
we end up get-

or we are more likely to be unwell after an exam period.

118
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,290
It's of course related to stress as well.
这当然也和压力有关

119
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,250
But sleep in and of itself-
但睡眠本身

120

enough sleep strengthens our immune system.

There are a lot of theories going around that well,

it's better to sleep five hours than seven hours
睡5个小时比7个小时好

124
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,340
because of certain cycles.

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,420
And yeah,these cycles exist.

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,940
But in general,more sleep to a point is better.
但普遍来说 在一定程度上睡多一些更好

sometimes it's associated with going difficult times;

sometimes it's associated with depression.

sleeping too much.

133
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,430
it may mean that you need 10 hours a day.
这可能意味着你需要一天睡10个小时

Doesn't mean that you are depressed.

135
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,230
Doesn't mean that there's something wrong.
而不是说你有什么毛病

136
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,980

More sleep is generally better up to a certain point.
在某些程度上说越多的睡眠通常越好

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,340
We talked about physical exercise and that when we don't exercise

what we are doing is our weight goes up beyond its base level,

beyond its God given or genes given,our natural state,

144
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,660
when they are not associated with exercise.
节食减肥会失败

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,070
The same applies to sleep.
对于睡眠也是同样的道理

146

our dreams become more pleasant.

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,970
And whenever I go home,my mom makes lasagna.
我每次回家 我妈妈总给我做千层面

719
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,940
But that does not mean I want lasagna every day all day.
但那并不是说我需要每天整天都吃千层面

720
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,940
You know five times a week is more than enough for me.
你知道一周吃5顿对我来说就够了

721
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,620
Or once a week.
或者一周吃一顿

722
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,640
But you need to find your quota- the same with relationships.
但是你需要找到自己的配额 人际关系也是一样

723
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,450
The same with relationships.
人际关系也是一样

724
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,740
Ask yourself: how many hours a day is good for me,
问问自己 每天和别人相处多少小时

725
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:19,810
pleasant for me,enjoyable for me to spend with other people.
我就觉得愉快 觉得和人相处是一种享受

726
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,030
One of the things that differentiates people
决定这个合适时间的因素

727
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,540
in terms of the right amount is introversion and extraversion.
就是看你是内向还是外向

728
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,290
We actually have physiological,
我们都有一个

729
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,580
base level of where we are compared to the optimum.
相对于最优水平而言的心理基准水平

730
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,130
Let me illustrate.
让我来画个图

731
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,900
So there is what's called optimum level of arousal,
这是所谓的最优激励水平

732
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,140
cognitively speaking.
在认知学上说

733
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,490
Optimum level of arousal.
激励的最优水平

734
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:56,230
And this,let's say is our optimum level of arousal.
这是 比如说是我们的最优激励水平

735
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,500
And we are all born somewhere around this,either above,below-
我们生来就在这附近 有些人高 有些人低

736
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,810
very few people are right on the line.
极少有人正好在这条线上

737
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,790
Introverts have a higher level of arousal,
内向的人有更高的激励水平

738
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,720
higher innate level of arousal.
更高的先天激励水平

739
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,270
This is the introversion.
这是内向的人

740
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:25,040
Extraverts have a lower level of arousal,
相对于最优水平而言

741
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,710
compared to the optimum level.
外向的人有较低的激励水平

742
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,700
Now we all physically see,or emotionally,
现在我们都身体上 或者精神上

743
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,180
cognitively and physically
认识上并身体上

744
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,340
look for experiencing the optimum level of arousal
寻求体验的最优激励水平

745
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,980
because that's the most convenient.
因为那是最方便的

746
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,660
That's when we are at our best.
那时候我们在最佳状态

747
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,880
That's when we enjoy ourselves more,
那时候我们心情更愉快

748
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,890
which is why introverts whose innate natural state
内向的人的天生自然状态

749
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,680
is above the optimum level of arousal,
是高于最优激励水平的

750
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,300
actually need to reduce level of arousal.
所以他们实际上需要降低刺激水平

751
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,460
So they enjoy spending time by themselves.
所以他们喜欢自己单独呆着

752
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,730
In contrast,extraverts have a lower arousal level.
与之相反 外向的人有着较低的激励水平

753
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:14,190
And it's not as pleasant as when they get it to the optimum level
这个水平没有他们达到最优水平时那私愉快

754
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,950
So they go out to a party where there is a lot of arousal,
于是他们出门去参加派对 那里有很多刺激

755
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,300
a lot of things happening,
有很多事情发生

756
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:26,330
a lot of people in order to get their optimum level of arousal,
有很多为了达到自己最优水平的人

757
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,100
which is why generally...
这就是为什么普遍来说…

758
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,480
What does alcohol do?
酒精起什么作用?

759
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,050
Alcohol reduces our level of arousal,
酒精降低我们的激励水平

760
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,400
which is why introverts very often need a glass of wine
这就是为什么内向的人常常需要

761
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,140
or a bottle before they dance.
在他们跳舞前喝杯酒或喝瓶酒

762
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,280
Because to dance
因为当着

763
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,540
while other people are watching increases level of arousal.
其他人的面跳舞会刺激水平上升

764
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,780
So what the alcohol does is reduce their level of arousal.
所以酒精的作用是降低他们的刺激水平

765
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,650
And then dancing is comfortable and they are fine with it.
然后跳舞就容易接受了

766
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:57,030
In contrast,many extraverts need coffee
与之相反 外向的人需要咖啡

767
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,150
which is a stimulant in order to stay awake.
咖啡是保持清醒的刺激物

768
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:06,580
Because the coffee gets them up to their optimum level of arousal
因为咖啡让他们上升到自己的最优激励水平

769
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,230
Again,I'm giving you a sketch of-
再一次 我给了你们一个梗概

770
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,480
again there's a lot of research
再一次 自Issac后数十年里有很多

771
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,710
ever since Issac for decades about introversion and extraversion.
关于内向和外向的研究

772
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,310
Now by the way this does not mean that we cannot act,-
顺便说下 这不是意味着我们不能…

773
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,810
in the words of Brian Little,- we cannot act out of nature,
用Brian Little的话说 我们的举止不能脱离本性

774
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,850
meaning an introvert can act like an extravert.
就是说一个内向的人可以举止像外向的人

775
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,700
Here I am- I'm an introvert and- by the way this is physio...
我站在这里 我是个内向的人 顺便说下这是心…

776
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,920
We are born with this state.It's innate.
我们生来就是这个状态 这是天生的

777
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,370
So I was born an introvert.
我生来就是内向的

778
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,950
And yet when I'm standing in front of the class,
但当我站在教室前

779
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,770
and sing beautiful songs,I'm acting like an extravert.
唱着优美的歌曲 我的行为像一个外向的人

780
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:48,230
However the important thing while we can act out of nature
但是当我们的举止脱离本性时

781
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:54,160
is to understand that very often this enervates us.
明白这样通常会让我们衰弱这点很重要

782
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,080
It takes away energy.
它会带走我们的精力

783
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,140
It's difficult for us because we are acting so if I'm here,
这对我们来说很难 因为我们在假装 所以如果我在这

784
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,120
when I teach,I go even higher-
当我上课时 我会变得更兴奋

785
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,070
even further from my optimum level of arousal.
离我的最优激励水平更远

786
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,530
And that takes away energy
这会消耗精力

787
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,280
which is why introverts after acting like an extravert
这就是为什么内向的人在表现得像外向的人之后

788
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,140
whether it's at a party or in a lecture,
无论是参加派对还是讲课

789
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,040
need what Brian Little calls a restorative niche.
都需要Brian Little所说的恢复龛

790
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,570
A restorative niche- a place to restore.

791
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,560
And that would be a place
在那个地方

792
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:25,650
where they would spend time one on one with someone,
人们可以和人一对一相处

793
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,410
or some hours of solitude,of recovery.
也可以给自己一点时间独处 恢复

794
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,220
Remember,the problem is not stress.
记住 这个问题不是压力

795
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,540
The problem is not stress.
这个问题不是压力

796
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,050
The problem is when we don't have recovery.
而是我们没有恢复

797
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,260
And introverts need recovery.
内向的人需要恢复

798
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,850
Some time on their own.Some time one on one.
有事是靠自己 有时需要一对一

799
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,400
So life for me,for example,form of recovery is office hours-
比如说我的生活 恢复的形式的坐办公室

800
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,580
easy for me to meet students you know for 4 hours straight.

It's a form of recovery.

802
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,640
If I was only teaching,and only standing in front of audience,

803
00:48:53,860 --> 00:49:00,250
that would ultimately lead to over work and to me being lethargic
那最终会导致过度工作 会导致我毫无生气

804
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,500
Same with an extravert.
外向的人也是一样

805
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,460
If you are an extravert,

sometimes you have to do introverts' stuff.
有时你需要做点内向的人的事情

807
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,290
So for example you need to study for an exam.

808
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,110
And yet it would be nice to study for an exam at the Cog,

809
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,870
but may be not that helpful.

00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,620
So you are studying by yourself or with one person.

811
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,240
And what do you need after that is a restorative niche,

812
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,970
because it's enervating for an extravert

813
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,970
to be far from their optimum level of arousal.

Know what your relationship needs are.

would be best for you- depends on your personal,unique needs.

men have someone they can share with,

866
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,800
whereas women have-more often,more likely-

00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,110
have their girl friends whom they talk to about certain issues.

However,both sexes in opposite and same sex relationships

870
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,390
benefit from intimate relationships.

871
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,440

[VIDEO: Clip of Everybody Loves Raymond]

You come home at night,and she's there.

You--you go to sleep,there.

00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,330
And I know that sounds like a bad thing.
我知道这听起来很恐怖

880
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:06,130
But it's not.It's not.
但是不是 不是

881
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,130
Not if it's the-- if it's the right person.

Then it's good.It's good.

Frank: I would like a minute for rebuttal.

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,450
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: So let's look at relationships.
那么我们来看看各种关系

886
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,240
First of all,let's look at the state of affairs-
首先 我们来看看婚外恋

887
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,640
as what's actually going on with relationship,
看看到底今天

888
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,760

What we see is not a very pretty picture.
我们看到可不是非常好看的景象

891
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,930
So when it comes to marriages,
就婚姻而言

892
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,740
2/3 of marriages today end up in divorce.
如今三分之二的婚姻都以离婚收场

893
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,390
This does not mean that the other third are thriving.
这并不意味着剩下那三分之一就过得很好

894
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,190
Because very often,very often,
因为经常 经常

895
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:16,740
people stay together out of a sense of duty,out of habit,
人们在一起是因为责任感 习惯

896
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,470
because of a lack of alternative,
因为没得选了

897
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,000
because they think this is their lot in life.
因为他们认为这就是他们的命运

898
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,120
Now this- and I'm certainly not going to argue for the fact that
现在 我当然不是要去论证

899
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,060
there are no marriages or relationships that should be dissolved.
所有婚姻或关系都不应该破裂

900
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,360
Of course there should be.
当然有

901
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,850
Not every relationship is right and we often make mistake.
不是每一段关系都是合适的 我们常常会犯错

902
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,410
But what I am gonna,the argument that
但我要表达的是

903
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,050
I am going to make is that many of the relationships that end,
很多结束了的关系

904
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,180
or many of the relationships
或者许多变成

905
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:47,160
that reach a state in the words of Thoreau,"quiet desperation",
用梭罗的话说"安静的绝望"的关系

906
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,990
of just being there,just sort of an inertia.
毫无生气 成了一种惯性

907
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,250
Many of these relationships
许多这样的关系

908
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,870
either should not have ended or can actually thrive.
要么不应该终结 要么实际上可以很好

909
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,490
The problem though is that
然而问题是

910
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,110
we see certainly with the two thirds who end up in divorce,
我们看到 当然有三分之二的人以离婚收场

911
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,320
but also with the other third very often

912
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,940
there's a failure to sustain love over time.
无法长期维持爱情

913
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:19,560
I don't know anyone who has gone to the wedding ceremony

914
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,960
or exchanged vows in another setting.
或者在别的结婚仪式上

915
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,060
I don't know any couple who did that and say,
会有哪对夫妇说

916
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,330
"well,this is just temporary.We are going to do it for you know,
"这只是暂时的 我们将…你懂的

917
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,930
2 years until death do us part,but not really."
携手2年 直到死亡把我们分开 但也不见得"

918
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,880
You know when people go into a relationship,
你知道当人们步入一段关系中时

919
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,030
their thought,their hopes
他们的想法 他们的希望

920
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,730
is to continue the exact same love and passion
是延续他们在关系最初时

921
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,330
that they have at the beginning of the relationship.
拥有的那份爱与热情

922
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,070
This is how relationships start.This is the promise of love.
这就是关系如何开始的 这是爱的承诺

923
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:50,510
And yet more often than not,evidently things don't turn out
但是通常 很显然

924
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,640
as we expected them to have turned out.
事与愿违

925
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,120
One of the main reasons for it,and one of the reasons that
一个主要原因

926
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:02,690
is cited by numerous sex therapists or psychologists-
一个被许多性治疗师和心理学家引用的原因

927
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,820
again you don't need to research for that,
再一次 你不需要研究它

928
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,870
because it's so self-evident.
因为这是如此地不证自明

929
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,920
One of the reasons is because love,
一个原因是因为爱情

930
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,230
and especially lust and passion wears over time.
特别是欲望和热情会随着时间磨灭

931
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,800
Because we know that novelty produces higher levels of arousal,
因为我们知道新鲜事物产生更高的激励水平

932
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,970
or in the words of Daryl Bem from Cornell University,psychologist
或者用康奈尔大学心理学家Daryl Bem的话说

933
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,970
"the exotic is erotic."

934
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:33,500
If it's new,it's more interesting,more fascinating.
如果是新鲜事物 它总是更有趣 更让人着迷

935
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,160
And this explains why so many relationships end.
这就解释了为什么这么多关系都破裂了

936
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,490
The question though is- is that necessarily part of our nature?
但问题是…这必然是我们本性的一部分吗?

937
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,730
And the answer is yes and no.
是也不是

938
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,130
Yes,
是

939
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,480
it's necessarily part of our nature that novelty excites us more,
新奇的事物更能刺激我们 我们适应变化

940
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,230
that we adapt to what happens.
这必然是我们本性的一部分

941
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,900
Remember we are change detectors.
记住 我们是会改变的探测者

942
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,980
We become much more aroused,
当新事物出现时

943
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,050
whether it's cognitively,psychologically,or physically,
我们变得更加受激励 不论是从认知 心理学

944
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,900
physiologically when there's something new.
还是身体 生理学上说

945
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,820
And we adapt over time it for good and ill.
我们随着时间变化适应着 不论好与坏

946
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,370
Now it would be wonderful
所以如果不是以好结果为目标的事件

947
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,800
if that wasn't the case for positive events,
如果不是找情侣这样的积极的经历

948
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,800
for positive experiences such as finding a romantic partner.
这种能力是很好的

949
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:21,880
But it isn't.
可惜不是

950
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,400
The question is- what do we do with it?
问题是 我们该怎么办?

951
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:25,750
Let me first share with you
在我们开始讲"我们怎么办"之前

952
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,210
before we get to "what do we do with it"-

959
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,280
And I posed this question to my sophomore class,

960
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,290
when I taught a sophomore tutorial in psychology.
