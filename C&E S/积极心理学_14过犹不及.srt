00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,540
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Hi.Good morning.
各位早上好

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,330
Good morning.Welcome back.
早上好 很高兴又见到大家

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,590
Hope you had a wonderful break.
希望你们都度过了一个愉快的假期

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,230
That you took time to recover,to de-stress.
恢复元气 释放压力

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,720
And as it happens,this is the topic today.
这也是今天的主题

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,150
We'll continue from where we left off before break.
我们接着上节课继续讲

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,980
So remember we talked about the idea that in fact,
上回我们提出 事实上

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,080
stress wasn't the problem,
压力不是问题

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,800
which was the most interesting,surprising- but in retrospect,
这是压力研究最有趣 最令人惊讶

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,590
obvious finding of the research on stress.
现在看来 也是最显著的发现

11
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,420
That stress in and of itself is actually good,
压力本身其实是件好事

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,390
just like in athletics,just like in sports,
就像在体育运动中

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,840
when we stress a muscle,the muscle develop- it grows.
我们给肌肉以压力 肌肉就会发展 增长

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,750
When we stress ourselves psychologically,emotionally,we grow.
我们心理上情感上给予自己压力 我们就会成长

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,250
We become more resilient.We become stronger.
变得更开朗 更坚强

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,740
It's not good for a person
从小在无菌环境里长大

17
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,070
who's just born to be put in a sterile environment
从未受过外界任何压力

18
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,400
and be protected from all the stresses of the outside world,
对人是不利的

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,420
such as bacteria for example,which stresses the system.
比如影响机体的细菌

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,620
Cause it forces to grade antibodies.
会使人体产生抗体

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,260
It's not good for us to be in a sterile environment,
所以长在无菌环境中对我们是不利的

22
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,150
not physically- whether it's in a closing environment as babies,
不仅指生理上婴儿的密闭环境

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,630
not physically in terms of not doing sports,
缺乏运动

24
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,180
not pushing ourselves,and also not mentally and emotionally-
还包括心理及情感

25
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,130
which is why I said you know time and again: I wish you fail more
所以我常常说 我希望你们遭受更多的失败

26
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,530
Because I think it is important to go through hardships,
因为艰难困苦

27
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,860
through difficulties.
能给予我们极大的锻炼

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,060
And in fact,we are going to talk about failure
结束"目标设定"的课程后

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,170
right after we finish up with the "Goal setting" lecture,
就会开始关于失败的课程

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,170
when we discuss perfectionism,
我们会讨论完美主义

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,750
which is all about our approach toward failure.
也就是对待失败的态度

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,150
So stress is not the problem.The problem is lack of recovery.
所以问题不是压力 而是缺乏休整

33
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,180
And that is what we don't have enough of in our culture-
不仅仅在哈佛 我们的文化中

34
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,850
not just at Harvard.
都对休息缺乏重视

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,270
Most workplaces- there is not enough place for recovery;
大多数办公场所 都没有足够的地方进行休整

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,920
in most school,most universities- which explains
大多数学校 大学

37
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,180
why levels of stress translate themselves to chronic stress,
所以压力转变为慢性压力

38
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,650
translate themselves to chronic anxiety,
变成了长期焦虑

39
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,010
translate themselves to depression.
变成了抑郁症

40
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,940
It's because we don't have the recovery.
就因为我们没有休整

41
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,030
And we talked about recovery on the a few levels-
我们还讲了不同层面的休整

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,690
so just a quick recap.
快速回顾一下

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,090
We talked about recovery on the micro level,which is,
微观层面上 休整可以是

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,690
for example,every 90 minutes of sprint,15 minutes break-
比如 每冲刺90分钟 就休息15分钟

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,260
instead of marathon runners,being sprinters.
不要做马拉松运动员 要做短跑运动员

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,800
It's 15 minutes meditation.
可以是15分钟冥想

47
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,380
It's a one hour lunch,
一小时的午餐

48
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,280
where we really give ourselves time to recover.
给自己时间好好休整

49
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,990
It's going to the gym on a regular basis.
可以是定期去健身房

50
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,670
It's the 15 minutes of listening to our favorite piece of music,
听15分钟喜欢的音乐

51
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,050
speaking to a friend or whatever it is.
与朋友聊天 等等

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,380
The recovery on the micro level.
这是微观层面上的休整

53
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,910
And people who recover,who have recovered during their work day-
上班时间进行休整的人...

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,150
and this is research done across the river
河对岸的Teresa Amabile和Leslie Perlow等人

55
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,170
by people like Teresa Amabile or Leslie Perlow,
经过研究发现

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,160
show how important it is in a workplace to have recoveries
如果工作场所能提供休整

57
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,640
and people who do it are more productive,
能使员工效率更高 更有创意

58
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,940
more creative and in the long term,also happier.
并且长期来看 会更幸福

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,140
Higher levels of job satisfaction.
提高工作满意度

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,120
Recovery also on the mezzo level the full night sleep,
中度休整包括一夜好眠

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,230
the day off during once a week at least.
每周至少休息一天

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,520
Time off recreate so that we can create.
放松休息以便重新投入工作

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,430
And finally,the vacations.Holidays.Longer periods.
最后还有假期 节假日 长假

64
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,780
You see,the other thing that happens
如果我们片刻不停的运作

65
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,110
when we are constantly on the run is that
会发生什么

66
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,900
we miss the beauty that's all around us and within us.
我们错过了身边和自身的风景

67
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,920
We miss the real potential for happiness,for joy,
错过了获得快乐幸福

68
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,760
for appreciation that surrounds us day in and day out.
欣赏日常生活中美的机会

69
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,220
And that's why we take things for granted.
所以我们把一切都当做理所当然

70
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,650
Because we don't take the time to appreciate,to savor.
因为我们没有花时间去欣赏体会

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,680
And it's not natural to do so.
这有悖自然

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,500
I mean can you imagine?
你们能想象

73
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,270
Can you imagine a lion living in our modern world?
一头狮子生活在现代世界?

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,110
Can you imagine a lion working at McKinsey?
在麦肯锡或者投资银行上班

75
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,450
Or in investment banking? Or being on the tenure track?
或者成为终身教授?

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,030
It's unnatural.You know what a lion needs to do is yawn.
这很反常 大家都知道狮子要打瞌睡

77
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,250
They need to play.It is natural.
要追逐嬉戏 这才正常

78
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,400
And remember what we talked about
还记得我们头几节课

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,930
during the first couple of lectures?
怎么说的吗

80
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,000
The constraint view of human nature-
人性中视野的局限性

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,080
nature to be commanded must be obeyed.
服从权力

82
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,440
Our nature dictates that we need recovery.
人的天性需要休整

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
All animals do.
所有动物都是

84
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,760
And when we frustrate a psychological,physical need,
如果我们违背心理或生理需求

85
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,030
we pay a price for it,whether it's the need for recovery
就会为此付出代价 无论是需要休整

86
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,500
or the need for physical exercise,
需要身体锻炼

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,490
or the need for certain vitamins or protein.
还是需要某种维生素或蛋白质

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,280
We pay a price for it.And the key is,
我们会为此付出代价 关键是

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,590
to introduce these natural recovery periods into our lives.
将这种本能的休整期引入我们的生活

90
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,230
And here is the key.The key is focus.
关键就是集中注意

91
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,870
Focus on both work as well as recovery.
同时关注工作与休整

92
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,420
So remember the question that we asked before break.
想一下我们节前提出的问题

93
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,880
What makes some individuals succeed despite
处于相同的现代社会 拥有相似的雄心壮志

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,420
living in a modern world or living with ambition and success?
为什么有些人能获得成功?

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,350
Well these individuals know how to focus
他们知道

96
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,830
when they work,when they play.
何时聚焦工作 何时聚焦玩乐

97
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,340
To use a cliché,they work hard and they play hard.
套句老话 他们努力工作玩得开心

98
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,660
What does that mean specifically? First of all,in recovery.
具体是什么意思呢?首先 要休整

99
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,030
They understand that quantity affects quality.
他们明白多则劣 少则精

100
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,420
Let me share with you a study that you read about in the book.
我们来看一下诺贝尔奖得主

101
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,590
This is by Nobel Prize winner,
以色列心理学家Daniel Kahneman

102
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,710
the Israeli psychologist Daniel Kahneman.
进行的一项研究

103
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,800
Won Nobel prize for economics,turned positive psychologist.
他曾获得诺贝尔经济学奖 后来成为了积极心理学家

104
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,930
What he wanted to understand was the affective,
他希望研究一天内

105
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,910
the emotional experiences of women during the day.
妇女的情感感情经历

106
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,930
And what he did was ask women to evaluate their experiences
他让一些妇女在经历了某些特定事件后

107
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,590
right after they had that particular experience:
对此经历做出评估:

108
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,100
so what was it like for you?
刚才的感觉怎么样

109
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,960
And they evaluated their experience at work.
这些经历包括工作

110
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,950
They evaluated their experience shopping.
购物

111
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,130
They evaluated their experience
与亲密伴侣 孩子

112
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:03,620
spending time with their intimate partners,with their children,
共处的时光

113
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,100
having lunch with friends,whatever it was.
与朋友共进午餐 等等

114
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,160
They evaluated how they were doing during the day.
评估一天内她们的心情

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,850
The most surprising finding of this result was that
结果令人惊讶

116
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,820
these women did not particularly enjoy time
这些妇女并不特别享受

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,810
they spent with their kids.
与孩子共处的时光

118
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,840
Now this result was very surprising to Kahneman.
这一结果让Kahneman很吃惊

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,520
When he probed further- he and his co-authors:
他和合作者进一步研究发现

120
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,530
it wasn't the fact that the women didn't love their kids.
这些妇女并不是不爱她们的孩子

121
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,790
I mean they love their kids.
她们很爱孩子

122
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,130
For most of these women,kids were the most meaningful,
对其中大多数人来说 孩子是她们生活中

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,530
important thing in their lives.
最有意义 最重要的一部分

124
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,800
However,their experience with their kids
但是 她们与孩子共处的经历

125
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,080
often was not pleasurable- the second component of happiness.
通常并不愉悦 这是快乐的第二个组成成分

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,030
very meaningful,but not always pleasurable.
有意义但不愉悦

127
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,940
Why? When they probed further,they found out exactly why.
为什么呢?他们进一步研究揭露了确切的原因

128
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,430
Because these women,when they were with their kids,
因为这些妇女与孩子共处时

129
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,680
they were not really with their kids,
并不是真正全身心与孩子在一起

130
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,140
meaning they were on the phone at the same time,
可能同时还打电话

131
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,800
or doing email,or thinking about what they had,
或者写邮件

132
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,170
they did earlier at work,or what they had to do later at home.
思考上班的事 或者要做的家务

133
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,180
They were distracted.And they were not present with their kids.
她们一心多用 并没有全身心与孩子一起

134
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,990
Now individually,discreetly,
单独来看

135
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,490
they may have very enjoyed being on the phone with a friend,
她们可能和乐意与朋友讲电话

136
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,800
or doing work,or thinking about work,
工作 思考工作

137
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,210
or thinking about what they have to do later.
或者等下要做的事

138
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,970
Each discreet individual activity may have been a lot of fun.
这些活动单独发生可能很有趣

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,060
But together,it was too much of a good thing.
但是同时进行 就乐极生悲了

140
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,390
And quantity affects quality.
量影响质

141
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,010
I mean,thinking about the following analogy.
听听这个类比

142
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,480
Think about the following analogy.
听听这个类比

143
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,020
Think about your favorite piece of music
想想你闭着眼睛 全神贯注地

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,040
and listening to it with your eyes close and focus.
听你最喜欢的音乐

145
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,340
So your favorite piece of music- if it's like mine,
我最喜欢的歌是

146
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,190
probably is Whitney Houston's "And I will Always Love You".
惠特尼休斯顿的《我会永远爱你》

147
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,300
Thank you.Yes.
谢谢

148
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,290
There's another one here with good taste in music.
英雄所见略同

If we can help people to simplify their lives,

and at the same time we are on the phone and doing email,

217

while you are doing work that requires concentration,

that requires focus- whether it's writing,or doing reading,

or anything else that requires concentration-

OK.It's the majority.

It's most people in the West that,who do that.

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,720
I used to do that too.Until I found out about this research.

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:39,250
it is equivalent to taking off 10 IQ points.10 IQ points.
等于智商减少10 整整10分

233
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,500
Now I don't know about you; but I can't spare 10 IQ points.
我不知道各位怎样 但我可不能少10点智商

234
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,420
Now for comparison's sake,if you lose a whole night sleep,
作为比较 如果你一整晚通宵

235
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,990
so if you haven't slept for 36 hours,

236
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,490
your IQ is reduced by the equivalent of 10 points.
也等于智商减少10点

237
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,000
Another point of comparison: if you smoke marijuana,

if you smoke grass,your IQ's reduced by 4 points.
智商会减少4

239
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,320
So if you have- look I mean it's the choice-

240
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,410
more fun,less IQ points.Well but don't inhale.
是要找乐子 还是降低智商 但千万别吸毒

241
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,370
Now I hope you didn't record that there.Here is the study.

at work fell by 10 points,

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,390
the equivalent of missing a whole night sleep,

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,410
and more than doubled 4.4 seen after smoking marijuana.
抽大麻才4.4点 比这2倍还多

247
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,280
Look,nothing will happen
听着 如果你关邮箱2小时

248
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,100
if you switch off your email for 2 hours at a time.
不会发生什么大不了的事

Nothing will happen.Except for thing that will happen.

You'll get another message saying,

you know- the server may have been down or,

00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,090
Right you get those emails,
其实你收到邮件了

254
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,380
if you don't respond for about an hour or two,
如果一两小时内不回复

255
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,840
the server may have been down.
对方就以为服务器挂了

256
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,780
But other than that,nothing will happen,
除此以外 什么也不会发生

257
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,240
if you don't respond to emails,
即使你不回复

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,660
if you don't have your emails on for two,three hours.
即使把邮箱关个两三小时

259
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,210
Nothing will happen if you don't answer the phone every moment.

260
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,740
Unless you are an ambulance driver,
除非你是救护车司机

261
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,460
in which case you should have it on.
那还是开着电话吧

262
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,610
But otherwise,it's fine.Switch it off.
除此以外 都可以关了电话

263
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,590
Doing less- and when you do less,you get so much more done.
少做点事 可以完成得更多

264
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,760
Creativity goes up.Productivity goes up.Work satisfaction goes up
创造力提升 效率提高 工作满意度提升

265
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,920

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,480
there can't be too much of a good thing.
就会过犹不及

about doing gratitude exercise,about writing a gratitude letter.

We are going to talk about doing more physical exercise.

271
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:59,490
We talk about act of kindness and so many things,but
仁爱之举 等等

272
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,350
really the key thing is actually not to do the additional things,
但是最关键不是要多做事

273
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,110
but to do less,or rather to identify the things that

274
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,950
you really,really want to do with your life and do them.
你真心想做的 然后坚定不移地执行

275
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,300

has done research on time affluence.
做过一项关于时间充裕的研究

278
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,790
As we know from research,

material affluence matters very little to our well being,

beyond having our basic needs met,

281
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,770
hardly even affects our well being.
几乎不会影响我们的幸福感

282
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,990
However,what does affect our well being
但是 的确会影响我们幸福感的

283
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,620
is what Kasser calls "time affluence",
是Kasser所说的"时间充裕"

284
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,760
which is the feeling that we have time,

the feeling that we can savor the things that we are doing,

286
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,620
that we are not constantly chasing our own shadow,

287
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,670
that we are not constantly running around and feeling stressed.
东奔西跑 压力巨大

288
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,500
And people who have time affluence in their lives-
时间充裕的人

289
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,020
that is a good predictor of well being.
往往容易获得幸福感

290
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,280
And that is something that we can introduce.
这点我们可以详细介绍

291
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,220
Granted,more difficult in a place like this
即使现代生活

292
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,020
where there are so many appealing distractions.
充斥着种种使人分心的诱惑

293
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,910
I'm using the word "distraction" here,
我用了"使人分心"这个词

294
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,930
even though many of these things
虽然这些诱惑

295
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,020
may be wonderful,amazing,meaningful things to you.
对你来说可能美好精彩 意义非凡

296
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,660
But when they all come together,
但如果同时出现

297
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,210
it becomes unfortunately the experience of distraction.
很不幸 会让你分心

298
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,200
You know modern world functionality is being pitted against fun.
现代社会的运转常常与快乐对立

299
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,580
The questions is
所以问题是

300
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,950
how do you make our life fun as well as functionality,
如何让我们的生活 充满乐趣同时又正常运转

301
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,580
which is parellel to the present and future benefit.
类似于当下与未来的利益

302
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,090
And what we know is that we recovery,fun recovery in our lives-
我们知道要休整 重拾生活中的乐趣

303
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,720
listening to our favorite piece of music and
听喜欢的音乐

304
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,880
only listening to our favorite piece of music and one at a time;
而且每次只能一首

305
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,140
or having lunch with friends
或者与朋友共进午餐

306
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,850
or nice dinners in our house with our roommates.
与室友在家一起享用晚餐

307
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,650
When we savor the time together,
当我们一起享受时光时

308
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,210
it's not just fun,it's also functional.
不仅仅是快乐 而且有用

309
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,700
It's also a formal recovery.
是正式休整

310
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,740
The question is how do you reconcile? How do you do the 'and'?
问题是如何调和快乐与有用?

311
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,910
Cause remember the question that positive psychologists ask:
还记得积极心理学提出的问题吗

312
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,200
what do people who are happy,healthy AND successful do?
快乐 健康且成功的人士 是如何达成这一切的?

313
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,570
And once they started to ask this question,
这一问题一经抛出

314
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,500
it opened up all the possibilities,
就打开了所有可能性

315
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,840
all the answers came rushing in literally.
出现了各种各样的回答

316
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,110
And one of the answers is- focus on work,focus on recovery.
其中一种回答是 聚焦工作 聚焦休整

317
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,670
You'll get much more done and much better.
则工作效率更高 质量更佳

318
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,730
One of the shortest- or the shortest word-
英语语言中最短的

319
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,190
in the English language and yet people are so afraid of it,
但又人人害怕的单词是

320
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,690
saying "no"-
"不"

321
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,450
whether it's saying no to people who ask you something,
无论是对寻求帮助的人说不

322
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,280
again saying no empathically,or saying no to opportunities.
还是对眼前的机遇说不

323
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,630
Because essentially when we are saying no to some opportunities,
因为我们对某些机遇说"不"

324
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,250
when we are saying no to some offers,
对某些提议说"不"时

325
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,600
we are saying yes to ourselves.
其实是对自己说"是"

326
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,290
And how do we choose what do we say no to
那如何选择对什么说"不"

327
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,030
and what do we say yes to? C
对什么说"是"呢

328
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,230
By simply asking what do I really,really,really want to do.
很简单 问自己究竟想要什么

329
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,510
Simplifying- doing less,rather than more.
简化 宁缺毋滥

330
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,840
The key though is to reach optimum levels of simplicity.
关键就是找到最适宜的简化程度

331
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Because we don't want to simplify too much
因为过于简化

332
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,880
and go to the other extreme.
就会走向另一个极端

333
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:22,310
You see,in a way,it works,as many things work,
和其他事物及诸多心理学显现一样

334
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,960
many psychological phenomenon work,in a curve linear manner.
简化与效率是以曲线形式存在

335
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,740
Let me explain.
我来解释一下

336
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:36,280
So let's say we have a graph where this is amount of work.
这张图表的X轴代表工作量

337
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:48,280
And on this axis we have productivity,creativity and happiness.
Y轴代表效率 创造力与快乐

338
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,760
The way it work,the way it looks,is this way,meaning:
两者的关系是这样的

339
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,560
if our amount of work is too high,
如果工作量太大

340
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,160
that's when we experience the TBD,Too Busy Disorder.
就会发生TBD 即忙碌紊乱症

341
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,050
We are unhappy; we are not creative; and we are not productive.
我们会不快乐 缺乏创造力 效率低下

342
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,210
This is the burn-out.
精疲力竭

343
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,210
We may be productive and creative for a short while,
也许短时间能效率和创造力能维持一段时间

344
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,320
but this is the burn-out phase.
但这点代表精疲力竭

345
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,520
On the other hand,if we do too little,that's also not good.
另一方面 如果我们什么也不做 那也不好

346
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,280
And very similar consequences- we are unhappy;
后果相似 我们会不快乐

347
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,390
we are certainly not productive; and we are not creative.
没有效率 缺乏创新

348
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,050
This is extreme procrastination,
这点代表极端拖延

349
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,420
which we will talk about in a minute.
我们马上会讲到

350
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,960
This is over work.
这点代表过度工作

351
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,510
What we want to find is our optimum-
我们要发掘

352
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,230
for each person,this is in a different place.
各自的最适宜点 每个人都不一样

353
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,870
I mean,this graph can be situated here for one person,
有些人 图的位置可能靠这里

354
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,780
and here for another.
有些人可能更靠前

355
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,330
But each person has this optimal level.
但是每个人都会有个最适宜点

356
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,520
And this is where highest level
这点代表了效率 创造力

357
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,740
of productivity,creativity and happiness is.
以及快乐的理想状态

358
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,020
So on the one extreme we have the law of gas
例如气体再少也能充满整个空间

359
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,320
essentially applied to time management.
也适用于时间管理方面

360
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,980
But even if we have very little work,
即使我们工作再少

361
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,270
it will take up all of our time.
它会占用我们所有时间

362
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,140
And then we are not productive,not creative,not happy.
这样我们变得效率低下 缺乏创造力 不快乐

363
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,760
On the other hand,we have- the quote that I've used time
另一方面是...我常常引用JP Morgan的一句话

364
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,420
and again by J.P.Morgan,that he can do a year's work in 9 months
他可以在9个月能完成一年的工作

365
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,960
but not in 12 and the need for time-off.
但不能花12个月 需要休息时间

366
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,180
Where is your optimal level? Where are you? Between these two.
你的理想值在哪里 这两者间你在哪

367
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,520
You need to find out.It's trial and error.
你得自己摸索 反复试验

368
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,580
And it's a lot of error.And that's OK.That's how we learn.
期间会犯很多错误 没关系 我们就是这样学习的

369
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,500
Essentially what we are about is sustainable growth.
本质上 我们关注的就是可持续增长

370
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,100
Henry David Thoreau: "Simplicity,simplicity,simplicity!
梭罗说过"要简单 简单 再简单

371
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,850
I say let your affairs be as two or three,
依我说 你要做的事应当是两三件

372
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,710
and not a hundred or a thousand;
而不是成百上千件

373
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,760
instead of a million count half a dozen...
数上半打 而不要数上百万

374
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,040
In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life,
在这多变的文明生活的海洋里

375
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,440
such are the clouds and storms and quick sands
云雾 风暴 流沙

376
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,310
and the thousand-and-one items to be allowed for,
和许许多多事情都得考虑

377
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,710
and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds.
他要成功 就必须是台出色的计算器

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,520
Simplify.Simplify ." This was written around 1840.
简化 再简化" 这段话写于1840年代

379
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,550
How much more do we need to simplify today,in the 21st century?
那到了21世纪 我们还要如何简化呢

380
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,460
And what we are about,again,is sustainable growth.
我们关注的是可持续增长

381
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,930
I've used this metaphor from environmentalism.
这一比喻借鉴自环境保护论

382
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,040
What's sustainable growth? So when a country like Senegal
什么是可持续增长? 比如塞内加尔

383
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,050
is now talking about sustainable growth,what does it mean?
想要进行可持续增长 该如何进行?

384
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,590
It doesn't mean that it wants to freeze progress.
这不是说他们停止增长

385
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,150
It means that it wants to grow,however,in a sustainable way,
而是指他们想要增长 但以一种可持续的方式

386
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,160
which means- "let's take out of the environment
也就说"对环境的损耗

387
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,500
what can be replenished naturally through our help."
要控制在可以人工帮助下自然恢复的范围内"

388
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,010
The exact same thing we are talking about
与我们所说的心理学概念

389
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,360
on the psychological level.
完全一致

390
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,600
We are not talking about a stress-free life,
我们提倡的不是

391
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,110
a life when we don't take out of ourselves,
无需奋斗 无需努力的

392
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,410
when we don't push ourselves,when we don't exert ourselves.
无压生活

393
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,730
What we are talking about
我们提倡的

394
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,200
when we are talking about sustainable growth is that
可持续增长是指

395
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,840
we take out of ourselves,we exert,we stress ourselves
我们努力奋斗 竭尽全力 给予自己一定压力

396
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,100
and we replenish through recovery just enough
然后通过充分的休整得以恢复

397
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,080
so that it is sustainable.
这才是可持续

398
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,610
Because if we don't replenish,then it's not sustainable
因为如果不恢复 那就无法持续

399
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,960
and then we begin to experience anxiety,depression,burn-out,
会出现焦虑 抑郁 疲惫

400
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,370
and so on.
等等情绪

401
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,530
So ask yourself.Where do I in my life need to simplify?
所以问问自己 我的生活需要简化什么

402
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,820
Where do I in my life need to do more?
我的生活还需要做些什么

403
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,110
How can I,in other words,overcome procrastination?
也就是说 该如何克服拖延心理

404
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,880
Going back to our friend.
回到我们朋友那

405
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,800
Because this may be a little bit too extreme.
因为可能有点太极端了

406
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,180
You know 70 percent,more than 70 percent of college students,
全国有70% 超过70%的大学生

407
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,500
nationwide complain about procrastination.
抱怨拖延心理

408
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,450
Not others' procrastination- their own procrastination.
不是别人拖延 而是他们自己拖延

409
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,650
The other 30 percent are in denial.No.
另外30%矢口否认

410
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,060
Over 70 percent.
超过70%

411
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,640
Now procrastination is associated with lower levels of happiness,
拖延与不快乐

412
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,470
weakened physical immune system,
生理免疫系统脆弱

413
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:18,380
higher levels of stress and could also lead to depression.
压力过大等等都有关联 可能会导致抑郁

414
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,270
Not a very high correlation,
虽然关联程度不高

415
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,890
but there is a positive correlation between the two.
但是两者呈正相关

416
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,320
Fortunately though,there is a lot of research on procrastination
幸运的是 有许多关于拖延的研究

417
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,320
A research that can actually help.
其中一项研究很有帮助

418
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,550
And the research is done at the University of Carleton in Canada,
这项研究是由加拿大卡尔顿大学

419
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,640
where they have an actual procrastination research group.
拖延心理研究小组进行的

420
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,150
And I went,I browsed them...
我浏览了...

421
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,610
You can go on their website- great website,
你可以访问他们的网站 做得很不错

422
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,190
and there are great pictures there.
还有许多有价值的照片

423
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,770
And one of the set of the pictures
其中一组照片

424
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,560
is from their yearly conference on procrastination,
是来自他们年度的讨论拖延心理的会议

425
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,720
which is remarkable.
该会议意义重大

426
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,220
So here are some photos from that very important conference.
这些是会议的照片

427
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,090
So on the first day they all arrived
所有人于第一天抵达

428
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,800
and they got together for a meal.
进行了聚餐

429
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,780
And after they got together for meal,they had another a meal
聚餐后 他们又吃了一顿

430
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,020
because they were hungry a few hours later.
因为几小时后有人又饿了

431
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,360
And then the following day they just hang out and walked around.
第二天 他们结伴出游 四处走走

432
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,280
It was a beautiful place after all.
校园风景很美

433
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,070
And afterwards,they had some food together.
然后 一起吃了点东西

434
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,880
And then,you know,food begets food so they ate some more.
然后 一顿接一顿 他们又吃了几顿

435
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,860
And at the end of the conference,
到了会议最后一天

they really felt like they got,they accomplished a lot.

You know they practiced what they preached.

First,most important one,simple,easy to implement and it works
首先 最重要的一点 很简单 容易实践且有效

444
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,750
It's what they call "the 5 minute take-off".
他们称之为"5分钟起步"

445
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,260
One of the things they found with,just about all procrastinator
他们发现所有拖延者都有一个共同点:

446
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:12,210
is that they have a misunderstanding of what it takes to act.
他们对行动的要求有所误解

447
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,620
Procrastinators,the world over,think that in order to act,

448
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,740
they first need to be inspired.

But you know what? That's not how it works.

453
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,350
That's not how it works.
并不是这样

It's not about first changing our attitude,i.e.

becoming inspired and then acting.
即受到激励 然后行动

456
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,970
It usually works the other way around.
恰恰相反

457
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,940
We first need to start acting,behavior,
要先开始行动

that will then affect our attitude.
行动会慢慢地影响我们的态度

我不知道你们是否留意到了

464
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,400

And sometimes within a 90 minute session,

I have to do another 5 minute take-off

Getting more and more severe,until the age of 20.21-
越来越严重 直到我20 21岁时

722
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,980
the doctor told me,"you have a choice.
医生告诉我"你面临一个选择

723
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,380
You can continue training and playing professional squash,
你可以继续训练 打职业壁球赛

724
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,500
but then you are risking your back
但你的背部会非常危险

725
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,710
and you probably need to be operated on very soon.
可能很快就需要动手术

726
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,700
Or you can give up professional squash."
要么就放弃职业壁球"

727
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,840
with an extremely heavy heart,I gave up professional squash.
怀着沉重的心情 我放弃了职业壁球

728
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:25,260
I gave up my dream,applied to college,and came here.
放弃了我的梦想 申请入学 来到了这里

729
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,640
Here,the exact same pattern continued-
同样的模式又发生了

730
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,400
only before it was squash;
只不过以前是壁球

731
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,170
now it was academics that became the central part of my life.
现在学术成了我生活的中心

732
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,540
The knot returned,very shortly after freshman week.
开学才一周 那个结又回来了

733
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,820
Because every paper had to be perfect.
因为每一篇论文我都力求完美

734
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,570
Every word had to be read and summarized.
书上每一个词都要阅读并总结

735
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,130
Every assignment had to be executed immaculately.

736
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,870
All or nothing.And I was unhappy.
要么全有 要么全无 我不快乐

737
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,140
And it was on one day during my sophomore year.
在我大二时的某一天

738
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:08,110
I was a 23 year old sophomore,where I said to myself,
当时我23岁 我对自己说

739
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,660
"enough.Enough.Here I am,in such a wonderful place,

740
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,300
with such wonderful students,such wonderful teachers.
有这么多出色的同学 优秀的导师

741
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,130
Such a privilege.And I am so unhappy.
应该感到荣幸 但我一点也不快乐"

742
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,740
I don't think it is something that is external.
我觉得这不是外部问题

743
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,910
I must understand myself better.
我必须更好地了解自己

744
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,850
And it was at that point that
于是

745
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:41,590
I decided to switch my concentration to philosophy and psychology
我转而研究哲学与心理学

746
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,250
wanting to understand the meaning of a happy life,
希望了解快乐生活的意义

747
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,400
wanting to understand how I could become happier
了解如何才能更快乐

748
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,560
and why I was not.
为什么我不快乐

749
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,560
And it was very quickly that I realized,
很快我意识到

750
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,810
that I understood that I was engaged,
我发现自己从事...

751
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,580
or suffering from something that is so common,
或者说遭受到某种普遍

752
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,820
so pervasive and so misunderstood.
且错误的观念折磨

753
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,620
Perfectionism.
完美主义

754
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,530
This is what I want to talk about today,
这就是今天

755
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,730
and what I want to talk about in the next lecture.
及下节课的主题

756
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,660
This notion of perfectionism
完美主义的概念

757
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,370
and what the research has to say about it.
以及对完美主义的研究

758
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,000
Now there is no perfectionist,
人无完人

759
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,130
there is no one person who is on this extreme,
没有人会处于糟糕的极端

760
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,000
nor there is a person who's on the excellence extreme
也没有人会处于卓越的极端

761
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,710
which I will depict later.
这点我等会儿会细讲

762
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,730
The key is how do I become happier
关键是 如何变得更快乐

763
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:38,160
and I become happier by being less and less perfectionistic.
随着我渐渐脱离完美主义 我变得更快乐了

764
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,620
Perfectionism is not about giving up ambition.
完美主义并不是说要放弃志向

765
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,310
I'm as ambitious,
我有志向

766
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:49,120
or possibly more ambitious than I was at age of 16 or 23.
甚至可能比16或23岁时志向更远大

767
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,670
It's about having a different approach
而是说对人生历程

768
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,350
toward the journey of our life,
对走出的每一步 尤其是对失败

769
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:59,920
toward each step of the way- specifically,toward failure.
采取一种不同的方法与态度

770
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,040
So what I'm going to talk about is first of all,
所以我要谈的第一点

771
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,620
define it so that we understand it.
先定义以便理解

772
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,720
Because it is misunderstood.
因为它常常被误解

773
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,800
I'm going to talk about characteristics.
我会谈谈完美主义的特征

774
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,110
We are going to get to that next time only.
我们下节课才会讲

775
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,790
The characteristics- what it means to be a perfectionist?
特征...成为完美主义者代表了什么?

776
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,660
Then I'm going to talk about the consequences.
然后我还会讲讲后果

777
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:26,170
And then,how it's possible to be both successful and happy.
以及如何保持成功与快乐的平衡

778
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,100
Again,the question we ask in goal setting lecture,
我们在目标设定课上问的问题

779
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,700
the question that essentially we are asking throughout the class-
这一问题我们在课堂上会经常重复

780
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,180
it's not about giving up success;
不是为了放弃成功

781
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,160
it's not about giving up the conventional currency.But
放弃日常生活中的金钱

782
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,210
it's about also enjoying the ultimate currency more importantly.
而是更好地享受我们的幸福

783
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,390
Because it is the ultimate currency.
因为它是终极货币

784
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,950
Then we understand what is the source of perfection;
然后我们理解完美主义的源头是什么

785
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,600
where does it come.
它来自哪里

786
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,710
Because if we understand where it comes from,
因为如果我们了解了它是如何产生的

787
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,610
we are more likely to be able to overcome it.
才更有可能克服它

788
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,660
And then,most importantly,how do we overcome it?
然后 最重要的是 如何克服

789
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,410
And how do we help other people overcome perfectionism?
如何帮助别人克服完美主义

790
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,870
And again,not giving up their ambition,not giving up hard work,
不是让他们放弃志向 或者停止努力工作

791
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,800
not giving up pain of failure- because that's inevitable.
也不是消除失败时的痛苦 这是不可避免的

792
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,990
But simply have a more rational,a more helpful,
而是获得一种更理性 更有益

793
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,090
a more empowering approach toward failure.
更可控的处理失败的方法

794
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:28,770
OK.So let's get to work.I need a volunteer.
好了 我们开始前 我需要一名志愿者

795
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,300
I need a volunteer,but before you put your hand up,
你们举手前 注意我的要求

796
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,480
it's a very special kind of volunteer.
我要一个很特别的志愿者

797
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:42,060
I need a volunteer who is a very good artist,
我需要一个很棒的艺术家

798
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,650

799
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,980
No pressure here,right? A volunteer who can draw really well
不要有压力 好吗 要一个画画很棒

800
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:57,390
and who will actually come here and demonstrate.
且愿意上来展示的志愿者

801
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,580
Now remember it takes courage to come up to the stage
要上台来需要一定勇气

802
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,080
but courage is not about not having fear;
有勇气并不代表不害怕

803
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,740
it's about having fear and going ahead anyway.
而是害怕但仍勇往直前

804
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,760
So do I have a volunteer? I have a volunteer.
有人自愿吗 有一个志愿者

805
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,440
Won't you come up? (Applause)

Are you a VS concentrator? (Inaudible)

808
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,600
Don't tell me you are an economics.OK.
别告诉我你是学经济的 好的

809
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:40,910
What are you? Biology.OK.Good.(Laugh) All right.
那你是什么专业的?生物 很好

810
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,890
So biology- you have to draw many diagrams.
生物学也要画许多图表

811
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,600
That's why I was...

Well in Ec you also have to draw diagrams I guess.
经济学也得画图标吧

813
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,190

所以也没关系

814
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,740
All right.Are you ready for this?

without having drawn hundreds and thousands of failed circles?

In other words,could you have gotten here without being here?

Absolutely not.There is no other way to succeed.

So the same time,you are talking to a friend.

904
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,150
Some of you are even chewing gum at the same time,

905
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,000
just more than Einstein could do.
连爱因斯坦都办不到

906
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,490
And then you lift up your back leg and again,so gracefully,

just you know,you bend your knee slightly.This action.

without having fallen hundreds and thousands of times?

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,430
Not even Vincent could have reached that stage without it.

It's not possible.Learn to fail or fail to learn.

921
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,280
And as kids,we know it.

we fall down and maybe we cry a little bit if it hurts,

when we begin to understand other people are watching us,

945
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,110

00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,590
"I'm not going to try,because what if I fall?"
"我不要试 万一摔倒怎么办"

953
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,850
And we avoid instead of coping.
我们开始逃避而不是应对

954
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:19,070
And that affects our self esteem,our confidence,our resilience,

our happiness levels in the long term.

"well,maybe I shouldn't do."

970
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,960
Because what happens if...? Well,what happens if?

971
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,860
what happens if is the worst case scenario: I learn.

or giving him the position of ultimate failure.
失败大王称号

989
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,770
And here is why.
原因如下

990
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,590
At the age of 22,already- just started a new job,lost it.
22岁时 刚找到新工作 就失业了

991
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,190
Didn't leave- he lost it.
不是辞职 是失业

992
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,020
At the age of 23,decided to go into politics

993
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,310
because he wasn't doing well in other jobs.

994
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,850
But didn't make it there either.
但是也没有成功

995
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:14,120
And then he went back to business,didn't make it there.
于是继续回去经商 又没有成功

996
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,530
At the age of 27,it was just too much for him.
27岁时 压力太大

997
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,780
Just too much- and he collapsed.

999

But then got up again after falling.
但又重新站起来了

1000
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,740
And at the age of 34,7 years after his nervous breakdown,
7年后 他34岁时

1001
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,780
he ran for congress- wasn't even close.

1004
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,670
And he was defeated again for congress.

1005
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,750
And then he said,"let me go try higher."
他说"让我试试更高层的"

1006
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:53,900
At the age of 46,what a loser! Doesn't learn,does he? OK.
46岁时 真失败啊 还没学乖

1007
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,580
Yeah.It's OK.Learn to fail.Fail to learn.
没关系 学会失败 从失败中学习

1008
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:59,850
But I mean you are 46 years old,c'mon! Give it up already.
你都46岁了 适可而止吧

1009

Hackman talks about were actually making more medical errors.

01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,480
didn't understand what happened,went back to the hospitals,

Because there are certain mistakes that you cannot hide.

It is very difficult to hide a corpse,for example.

they were out,and these groups had to report these.
