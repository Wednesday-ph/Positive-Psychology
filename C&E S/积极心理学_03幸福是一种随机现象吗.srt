And next week we are starting.
下周我们就开始

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,200
Last time,if you remember the question that we ask,
还记得上节课的问题吗

16
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,040
the guiding question was "why positive psychology?"
最主要的问题是"为什么要学习积极心理学?"

17
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,740
And I mentioned three reasons,
我提到了三个原因

18
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,160
Why we need it as an independent field as opposed to just being
为何我们把它作为独立的研究 而不简单地

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,780
"well,let's do some studies on happiness,on relationships"
"研究一下幸福和爱情"

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,370
as it is always being done?
不像一贯人们所做的那样?

21
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,020
The reason why we need positive psychology is to shift
我们需要积极心理学是为了改变

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,500
the pendulum from the 21:1 ratio that we have today:
现在的21比1这个比率

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,720
for every one study on depression or anxiety,
每有一项关于抑郁或焦虑的研究

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,290
we have 21 studies on-- sorry,
就有21项 对不起

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,960
for one study on happiness or wellbeing,
应该是每有一项关于快乐或幸福的研究

26
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,260
we have 21 studies on depression and anxiety.
就有21项关于抑郁或焦虑的研究

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,460
We want to shift the pendulum slightly.
我们想稍微改变这个比率

28
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,110
And I mentioned three reason
我提过三个原因

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,670
why we want to shift this pendulum despite the fact
关于为什么要改变这个比率

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,030
that there are rising levels of depression around the world,
尽管世界上越来越多人抑郁

31
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,750
that anxiety has become epidemic globally―
而焦虑就像是全球性流行病

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,010
on college campuses in United States,China,Australia,UK.
遍布美国 中国 澳大利亚 英国所有大学

33
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,490
Despite that fact,I argue that we need to shift the pendulum
尽管如此 我还是认为我们该改变那比率

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,530
and do more "positive research",or in other words,
做更多"积极研究" 或者说

35
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,370
research that focuses on what works.
集中研究可行的事

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,900
And the reason is―
原因在于

37
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,720
the first reason that we gave and we are just finishing up is
我们之前讨论完的第一个原因是

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,450
because the question that we ask,
我们提出的问题很重要

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,150
whether it's the research questions that we ask,
无论它是不是我们的研究问题

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,270

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,200
or our partners,matter.
或为我们的伴侣问的

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,660
And if our only questions,
如果我们只问同一类问题

43
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,770
or primarily our questions are "what is not working?

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,180
What is the problem?
出什么问题了?

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:50,470
Why are so many kids failing as a result of their circumstances?"

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,040
If we only ask these questions,

47
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,570
we will miss,literally miss an important part of reality,

48
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,280
just like you missed the children on the bus in the exercise.

49
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,910
Most of you did.
你们大多数人都没看到

50
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,370
And if we also ask the positive question,
如果我们也问积极问题

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,870
then some new possibilities,new quests open up,
那就会出现新的可能性 新的探索

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,270
just like they did for the researchers when they started to ask
就像他们对研究学者所问的一样

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,170
no longer "why do so many individuals fail?"

54
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,350
but started to ask "what do some individuals do and succeed?

55
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,490
Why do some individuals succeed
为什么有些人能成功

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,160
despite the unfavorable circumstances?"
即使成长环境恶劣?"

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
And then we have the story of Marva Collins,
我们会以Marva Collins的故事为例

58
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,300
who exemplifies so many of themes
她的例子很典型 能说明很多观点

59
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,440
that we'll talk about throughout the course.

64
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,550
whatever it is―from a passive victim to an active agent.
诸如此类的 从消极的受害者变成积极的作用者

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,790
Yes,it's difficult. It's tough. It's unfair.
是的 那很困难 艰辛 不公平

66
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,060
However,it's your responsibility. No one is coming.

It's up to you to make that difference in your life.

In other words,if we look at the case of Chicago school system

where Marva Collins was teaching,the conventional,

An important question to ask. However,not enough.

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,910
Marva Collins comes along and reframes the question.

81
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,630
And her question becomes

"how can we cultivate the seed of greatness in our student?"
"我们如何培养学生 激发他们的潜能?"

83
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,630
And that,once again,made all the difference,

84
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,170
because she saw the seed of greatness in each student.

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,840
because they did not ask this question;
因为他们没提出这个问题

89
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,290
because they asked,metaphorically speaking,

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,050
"how many geometric shapes do you see on the screen?"

Wherever we go,that is the fate of most human potential―

interpersonally,relationships,in most organizations,

in most universities,in most individuals.

101
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,350

What is the source of wellbeing?"
幸福源于什么?"

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,880
So that's the first reason. The second reason―

107
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,050
before I go to the second reason,

if Marva Collins is here today,

114
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,640
When we ask this question-- this very important question,

115
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,140
suddenly we see possibilities that we didn't see before.

Second reason for having positive psychology's field of study

117
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,450

psychosis and depression,are interconnected,of course.

It's very difficult to be happy

124
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,800
if we are experiencing severe depression or anxiety.
如果我们感觉很压抑或焦虑

125
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,870
So they are certainly interconnected. However,
就是说他们必然是有关联的 然而

126
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,060
just getting rid of the anxiety and the depression will not in

of many psychologists practicing psychologies―

Now if we have indigestion,it's very difficult to enjoy food.

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,780
So yes,we first need to get rid of the indigestion.
因此我们得先治好消化不良

139
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,810

does not guarantee us that we enjoy food.

We have to go out and eat the gourmet food to enjoy it.

142

to name a few-- on the negative side,the painful side;

152
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,050
wellbeing,satisfaction,joy,excitement,happiness

153
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,550
on the other side
属于另一方面

154
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,290
which is the side of positive psychology studies.
也就是积极心理学研究的方面

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,280
Again,getting rid of the negative
再强调一次 摆脱消极

156
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,150
does not guarantee us the positive,
不能保证我们变得积极

157
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,180
which is why already in the 1840s,
因此早在19世纪40年代

158
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,760
David Henry Thoreau (should be Henry David Thoreau),
梭罗

159
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,070
wrote that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.
认为 大多数人都活在沉默的压抑中

160
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,600
It's Ok. There's nothing really wrong.
这是没错的

161
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,440
But it's just somewhere there in the words of Pink Floyd

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,110
"people are comfortably numb". Comfortably numb.

163
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,140

How can we get beyond that "quiet desperation"?

To excitement,to joy,to happiness?

166
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,100
In order to do that,we need to cultivate these traits.
为了达到这目的 我们需用心经营这些情感因素

167
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Once again,they don't spontaneously emerge
再说一次 幸福不会自动出现

168
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,450
once the painful experiences go away.
并不是没有痛苦就能感到幸福

169
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,190
And that is why we need positive psychology.
因此我们才需要积极心理学

170
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,450
Positive psychology essentially focuses on the health model,
积极心理学本质上就是健康模型

171
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,340

176
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,740
of what is not working in their lives?

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,590
And under that model we see,to extremes on many levels.
根据该模型 我们在许多层面上都走了极端

178
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,430
Here,the first level:

It applies to leadership as well.

Positive psychology says let's focus also
积极心理学认为 我们至少

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,000
on our strength at least as much.

more excitement,more enjoyment,more passion?

Now there's something frightening about the health model.

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
and spend time on these questions,
并认真思考这些问题的人

297
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,940
are much more likely to begin a quest
所追求的

298
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,750
that is not the avoid of painful emotions―
不是避免痛苦

299
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,710
no quest is―
而是

300
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,740
but the quest is more enjoyable,more pleasurable,
追求更多快乐

301
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,500
more meaningful and also,more successful as it turns out.
使生活更有意义 更成功

302
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,520
But more importantly,more successful in

303
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,140
what I call the "the ultimate currency"―
称之为"终极货币"

304
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,290
just as the currency of happiness and wellbeing.
正如快乐货币和幸福货币一样

305
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,780
The reason is because there are two different approaches
究其原因 是因为有两种不同的方法

306
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:21,600
to deal with illness: one,the positive psychological approach is
对付疾病 一是积极心理学方法

307
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,870
that the illness is the absence of health,
它指的是 疾病相当于不健康

308
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,370
as opposed to health is the absence of illness.
相对地 健康等于没疾病

309
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,600
I mean,think about the disease model.
我们想一下疾病模式

310
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:40,700
The disease model is "we are sick because we are ill"―
疾病模式是 "我们感到不适是因为生病了"

311
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,020
do you listen to that? We are sick because we are ill.
听到吗?我们病了是因为我们在生病

312
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,590
That was very profound.
真的很深奥

313
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,850
You should think about it for a while here.
你们可能要好好想一下这句话

314
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,120
I'll let a time just to marinate it little bit so that you can.
可能要给点时间大家消化这话

315
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,030
Let me start that again.
我重新说一遍

316
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,930
If we take away the illness,then we become healthy.
如果治好病 就会变得健康

317
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,960
That's the model,the conventional model.
这是个传统的模型

318
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,920
Take away the illness. You'll become healthy. It's good.
把病治好 就会变得健康 这很好

319
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,890
The positive psychological model is slightly different.
积极心理学模型略有不同

320
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,840
It is
它说的是

321
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,110
"you are ill because you don't have enough health in your life,
"你生病了 是因为你的生活还不够健康

322
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,090
because you are not pursuing those things that make you healthy".
因为你不去追求那些让你健康的东西"

323
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,840
And what make you healthy?
什么使你健康?

324
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,790
The things I spoke about before: pursuing meaning,purpose;
这我之前已谈过 追求有意义的生活 人生的目的

325
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,000
cultivating healthy relationships.
培养健康的人际关系

326
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,540
If we don't have these things,that's when the illness comes in.
如果不具备这些 疾病就会趁虚而入

327
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,090
Now the difference between the two models,
两种模型

328
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,230
the health model and the disease model
健康模型和疾病模型的差异

329
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,690
is more than just semantic.
不仅仅是语义上的

330
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,880
Here is Abraham Maslow talking about neurosis,
这是Abraham Maslow所说的神经官能症

331
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,900
"Neurosis is a falling short of what one could have been
"神经官能症描述的是人能变成怎样

332
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,580
and even one could say,of what one should have been,
或是他该变成怎样

333
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,950
biologically speaking that is
从生理上来说就是是

334
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,520
if one had grown and developed in an unimpeded way.
一个人是否能顺利地成长和发展

335
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,820
Human and personal possibilities have been lost.
人类和个人的潜能已经消失

336
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,490
The world has been narrowed and so has consciousness.
世界逐渐缩小 意识也是

337
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,220
Capacities have been inhibited."
能力也被抑制"

338
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,640
Let me explain what he means here.
我来解释一下这话的意思

339
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,030
What he means is that we are ill because we do not cultivate
他是说 我们正在生病 是因为我们没有

340
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,220
what we are about enough.
尽力做好我们本该做到的事

341
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,880
We do not become self-actualized.
我们没做到自我实现

342
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,600
We don't do what we are supposed to do.
没做到该做的

343
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,970
We diminish ourselves and that's when we become ill.
我们削弱自身力量 因此才会生病

344
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,790
That's when we are unwell.
才会不适

345
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,170
This is very different from the disease model that says,
这和疾病模型所说的有很大不同

346
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,330
"Ok,you are unwell. Deal with that illness."
"好 你不舒服 那就治病去吧"

347
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,060
What he's saying: "No. You are unwell.
他说的是:"不 你不舒服

348
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,210
Focus on your health. Strengthen your health.

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,260
Because you are ill,

350
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,180
because you are not focusing enough on your health."
因为你没有注重健康"

351
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,560
He calls that,and I quote,
他将这称为

352
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,630
"a failure of personal growth".
"个人成长的失败"

353
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,600
That's when we experience neurosis.
如果我们感到焦虑

354
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,390
When we don't cultivate ourselves enough,
如果我们不注重培养自己的能力

355
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,820
we don't cultivate our relationships enough,that's when we fail.
不注重培养自己的人际关系 就会失败

356
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,830
And what the positive psychology is all about is precisely that―
积极心理学研究的是关于

357
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,790
cultivating personal growth,working on the positive.
培育自身成长和积极性

358
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,860
And we work on the positive on what comes of this side
我们研究积极性 它处于这一边

359
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,730
of the graph that you saw up there.
大家可以在这上面看到

360
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,930
On the positive side,when we cultivate these things,
在积极的一方 当我们注重培养这些情感因素

361
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,970
it also helps us deal much better

362
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,920
with the negative when dead arises.
消极因素

363
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,350
I want to quote Martin Seligman,

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,400
Now he's asking this question and the disease model

380
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,060
What he's saying here is the following:

"What we have learned over fifty years is that the disease model

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,940
he's saying "also".
而是说也可以用健康模型

the strengths that these teens already have."

focused on the health and cultivated it,

What does that mean? Let me draw two analogies.

Does it mean we don't get ill?

431
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,410
Of course not. We do.
当然不是 还是会生病

432
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,920
But it means that we get ill less often and when we do get sick,

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,070
we recover more promptly.

So it strengthens our immune system.

444
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,910
And another analogy we can use is of an engine.
另一个类比是关于引擎的

445
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,720
If we have a small engine,
如果我们用的引擎很小

446
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,850
and we have to pull the car up a steep hill,a difficult hill,
想把车开上一个陡峭崎岖的山坡

447
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,700
the engine is more likely to collapse,to blow up.
引擎很容易损毁 爆炸

448
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,960
Whereas If our engine is large,
但如果我们的引擎够大

449
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,090
we are much more likely to get up that hill,
要上那山就容易得多

450
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,450
and to do it gracefully with relative ease.
不费吹灰之力就能做到

451
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,540
So what we are doing: we cultivate the positive;
所以我们在做的是 培养积极性

452
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,290
we are strengthening our,metaphorically speaking,
按那个比喻来说 我们正在增强

453
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,580
psychological "engine";
心理"引擎"

454
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
and we are better able to deal with the negative to zero,
我们能够更好将负值转化为零

455
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,410
not to mention the fact that we are also able to become happier.
更别说还能变得更快乐

456
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,450
Because happiness does not just come spontaneously
因为快乐不会自发而来

457
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,360
when we negate unhappiness.
不会因为消除了忧愁 就变得快乐

458
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,730
I want to go back to our local village.
我想说说我们这里的事

459
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,540
So remember last time
记得上次

460
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,310
I put up the article by the Crimson (Harvard Crimson magazine)
我提出的《哈佛克里姆森》杂志里的文章

461
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,760
that was unfortunately I couldn't find
很可惜我找不到

462
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,180
a more recent one-- that was 2004?
更近期一点的 那是2004年的?

463
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,170
But the situation is rather similar today.
但今天的情况非常相似

464
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,100
And one of the things that the Crimson article said is that
那篇文章提到的一点是

465
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,220
we need to put more resources into mental health at Harvard.
我们需要为哈佛学生的心理健康投入更多

466
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,820
And that's important,I agree.
这点很重要的 我非常赞同

467
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,910
However,it's only part of the picture.
这只是其中一点

468
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,060
in some different places as well-- not only,as well.
投入到其他一些地方

469
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,660
Because it's just not enough to put these resources in places
因为只是投入资源

470
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,880
that help us deal with our depression and anxiety
帮助我们应对抑郁 焦虑和忧愁

471
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
and unhappiness directly.
是远远不够的

472
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,600
It is also important to put these resources in places
同样重要的是 投入资源

473
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,630
that help us cultivate capacity,
帮助我们培养自身能力

474
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,920
the capacity to deal with these difficulties and hardships
应对困难和艰辛的能力

475
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,360
when they arise and they will arise.
这些困难一直存在并会继续出现的

476
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,030
In other words,there has to be more resources put in places
换句话说 必须在以下方面投入更多资源

477
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,460
such as helping students identify their passions
例如帮助学生发掘

478
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,660
when they come here,
自己的兴趣

479
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,770
helping students identify their sense of meaning in life,
帮助学生发现人生的意义

480
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,810
helping students identify what they
使他们明确自己

481
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,630
really,really,really want to do,
真正想做的事

482
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,950
helping students overcome the pull,
帮助他们克服那种诱惑

483
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,130
the external pull that is often there,
身边常出现的诱惑

484
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,120
taking them away from their core,
会让他们偏离自己的道路

485
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,640
helping them chip away those limitations,
还有凿掉那些束缚

486
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,280
those voices,helping students identify who they really are,
摆脱杂念 帮助他们找到自己的真实个性

487
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,840
helping students identify their strengths
还有帮助学生了解自己的强项

488
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,200
and pursuing those while here at Harvard.
并在哈佛实现一切

489
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,400
All these capabilities,
所有这些能力

490
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,230
all these skills or skills that are mostly―
所有这些技能 大多数都

491
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,980
and I'm not just talking about Harvard―
我不只是说哈佛

492
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,920
globally-- not taught in schools.
而是全球范围内 没有一所学校会教这些技能

493
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,300
And we need to teach them.
所以我们需要教他们

494
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,790
This is not to say that what is going at Harvard
这并不是说哈佛现在

495
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,570
with numerous resources that we do have here is not important.
正投入大量资源的方面不重要

496
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,760
It is very important.
这些方面都非常重要的

497
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,030
Just take a small example:
举个小例子

498
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,640
the Bureau of Study Counsel.
学习咨询处

499
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,690
I don't know how many of you have used that resource.
我不知道你们有多少人利用过该资源

500
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,350
I've used it as an undergrad.
我念本科时已开始接触它

501
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,980
I still use it now,doing some work with them.
至今还在与他们一起做某些工作

502
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,510
I did some work with them last year.
去年我与他们合作过

503
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,000
And they are wonderful.
他们真的很棒

504
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,750
And at the same time,we also need to cultivate the positive,
同时 我们还需要培养积极性

505
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,240
to think more of the zero to the positive side
探究如何让我们从零点升到正直

506
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,400
of the equation as well.
该如何做

507
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,540
And this is what positive psychology does
这就是积极心理学的作用

508
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,050
and I hope this is what 1504 to some extent will help do.
我希望1504号课程在一定程度上会有帮助

509
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,380
To summarize,
总之

510
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,490
"the message of the positive psychology movement
"积极心理学运动提醒我们

511
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,760
is to remind our field that it has been deformed.
这个领域已与过去不同

512
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,740
Psychology is not just the study of disease,weakness,and damage
心理学不仅是对疾病 弱点和伤害进行研究

513
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,430
it also is the study of strength and virtue,
它也研究优点和美德

514
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,150
Treatment is not just fixing what is wrong;
治疗不只是修复错误

515
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,660
it also is building what is right.
同时也要塑造正确的东西

516
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,120
Psychology is not just about illness or health;
心理学关注的不仅仅是疾病或健康状况

517
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,050
it is about work,education,insight,love,growth,and play.
还包括工作 教育 洞察力 爱 成长和玩乐

518
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,780
And in this quest for what is best,
在追求理想状态时

519
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,550
positive psychology does not rely on wishful thinking,
积极心理学不会盲目主观

520
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,310
self-deception,or hand waving;
或自欺欺人 或敷衍了事

521
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,880
instead,it tries to adapt what is best in the scientific method
相反 它尝试用最科学的方法来探究

522
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,540
to the unique problems that human behavior presents
极其复杂的人类行为所表现出来的

523
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,570
in all its complexity."
特殊问题"

524
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,800
It's about bridging the Ivory tower and the Main Street
还涉及到如何将学校与社会连接起来

525
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,280
in the area that I believe is the most important one
这个我认为最重要的领域

526
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,060
and talks to each and every one of us.
对我们来说都有意义

527
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,770
I want to move on now.
好 我继续说下去

528
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,020
I want to move on to the next selective lectures―
我想先说说下一节关于选择的课程

529
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,720
two or two and a half lectures,
两节或两节半课

530
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,460
where I am going to be talking about
我将会谈到

531
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,690
the basic premises of this course.
本课程的基本前提

532
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,620
As I said earlier,
正如我刚才所说

533
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,450
this course is not a survey course of positive psychology.
本课程并不是积极心理学的调研课

534
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,180
It's very selective. It's about the question of questions.
这是关于选择"问题中的问题"的

535
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,990
What can help us individuals,
有什么可以帮助我们个人

536
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:27,020
what can help our community become happier-- not happy,happier.
帮助我们的社会更快乐 不是快乐 是更快乐

537
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,590
So by the end of these three months semester,
三个月后 期末时

538
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,260
you are happier than you were before.
你会变得更快乐

539
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,370
You are from now,you'll be hopefully happier than you were
到学期末 你很可能比现在的你

540
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,580
at the end of the semester.
更快乐

541
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,000
And so on and so on.
越来越快乐

542
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,470
So what are the basic premises?
基本前提是什么?

543
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,170
Where am I coming here when I think about this course?
备课时我想和大家说些什么呢?

544
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,770
Well what I want to do is to share with you
我想为大家介绍

545
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,250
the five basic premises.
五个基本前提

546
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,520
And these premises are going to be presented as something and―
介绍这些前提 要从

547
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,560
essentially it's opposite.
它的对立面说起

548
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,170
So that were clear from the outset:
下面这些问题非常明确

549
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,460
where we are coming from,where I am coming from,
我们从哪里来 我从哪里来

550
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,400
where the teaching staff is coming from―
教学人员从哪里来

551
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,490
and also so that we can build the foundation of the course.
了解这些后我们就能建立本课程的基础

552
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,470
Remember I talk those of you who were here the first time:
记得一开始我就跟你们说过

553
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,710
this course is built like a spiral
这课程就像个螺旋

554
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,360
Everything is intra-connected,
内部的一切都是相关的

555
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,390
what I talked about in the first class is connected to
第一节课讲到的内容

556
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,810
what I'm going to talk about today,
与今天要谈的课题有关

557
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,300
is going to be connected to lecture 19.
也和第19课有关

558
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,300
So in many ways the premises,
从许多方面来看 这个前提

559
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,920
coupled with what we discussed in the first two lectures,
跟我们开头的两节课有关

560
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,930
build the foundation of that spiral,
会建立这个螺旋的基础

561
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,350
upon which everything else will be built.
那其他一切就更容易建起来

562
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,680
So here are the five basic premises.
这里有五个基本前提

563
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,080
I'll go through them briefly now and elaborate on each
我会先简短地介绍一下 再逐个阐述

564
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,010
in the next couple of lectures,interweaving them
在接下来的几节课里 会分别对它们

565
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,440
with studies,research as well as applications.
进行学习 研究 和应用

566
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,400
First,this course as I mentioned first is about bridge building:
正如我开始时提到的 这课程是关于搭建桥梁的

567
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,730
bridge building among disciplines,eclectic,
搭建学科之间的桥梁 广集思源

568
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,650
and bridge building in terms of academia and Main street.
并搭建学术界与社会之间的桥梁

569
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,410
the specialization is very often dominant in academia.
专业化常在学术界占主导地位

570
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,480
The approach of this course,
本课程的做法

571
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,080
with all its challenges,is the opposite.
正好相反

572
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,560
Once again I wouldn't be teaching this class,
如果我认为没有改变的可能

573
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,910
if I didn't change is possible.
就不会教这节课

574
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,770
There is a lot of research in psychology,
心理学的研究有很多

575
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,280
a lot of evidence that shows how difficult change is.
很多证据显示 改变是非常困难的事

576
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,800
So I will argue that change is possible,
我认为改变是可能的

577
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
whether it's individual change,
无论是个人变化

578
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,670
organizational change.
还是组织变革

579
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,940
And we'll start to look at how it's possible.
我们将探讨为什么是可能的

580
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,780
Just the very basic level of the spiral.
这只是整个螺旋的最基本层次

581
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,950
We have an entire week just devoted to change.
我们本周只讨论"改变"

582
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,830
We will elaborate on that:
我们会详细讨论

583
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,550
techniques,methods,tools.
技巧 方法 工具

584
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,860
Third,premise related to the first
第三 这个前提与

585
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,180
internal factors primarily determine happiness―
决定幸福的内部因素有关

586
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,640
this is what I'm going to argue for―
这是我要讨论的

587
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,810
is opposed to happiness which is primarily function
与决定幸福的

588
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,620
of external circumstances.
外部环境无关

589
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,000
Not saying that the external circumstances are not important,
并不是说 外部环境不重要

590
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:00,360
we should focus also on improving them,bettering them,
我们同样应该注重改善外部环境

591
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,020
whether for ourselves,for society at large.
无论是我们自己 或对整个社会

592
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,720
However,happiness primarily―

00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,510
Let's just get them together. Let's get them in a room,

00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,270
The situation worsened.

Now we've known that.

that it is the most likelihood outcome
接触假设 只让人们一起交谈

898
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,160
of just contact hypothesis,just getting them to be together.
最可能的结果是引起更多冲突

899
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,730
And there were many people trying to resolve the conflict,

not just in the Middle East,else in the world,

903
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,390
Idealism and good intentions are not enough.
理想主义和善意是不够的

904
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,780
We need to merge,to mate the research with the practice.
我们需要将理论结合实践

905
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,410
And this is where you come in,
需要你们这样做

906
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,680
taking it seriously.
认真对待

907
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,120

because sometimes research doesn't deliver good news.

910
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,910
It would be much easier and nicer
如果仅仅是将

911
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,520
if we could just simply get
以色列人和阿拉伯人聚在一起 冲突就结束

912
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,000
Israelis and Arabs together and the conflict would end.

It would be much nicer and easier,smoother,

it would be much easier,

00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,510
by giving them positive feedback―
仅仅通过多一些赞美

00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,120
telling them how wonderful they are.

918
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,490
It's easy to do,right?

919
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,150
It feels good. They feel good. We feel good.
这样感觉很好 他们感觉良好 我们也是

920
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,440
But in the long run,it doesn't help,if it's only that.
但从长远来看 仅仅这样做并没有帮助

921
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,480
Much easier.
只是容易而已

922
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,700
And research very often delivers bad news,
研究往往带来坏消息

923
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,840
saying it's not enough-- the contact;
只是接触还不够

924
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,040
it's not enough to praise.
只是赞扬还不够

925
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,480
And then people choose subconsciously,
然后人们下意识地选择

926
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,310
not consciously to ignore the research and go with her heart.
不自觉地忽视研究所得的坏结果

927
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,520
And that's important to go with your heart.
虽然跟随自己的感觉是重要

928
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,590
But it's important to with the heart and the mind.
但更重要的是同时注重感觉和思维

929
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,830

Things would be so much easier without the law of gravity.

935
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,620
The design would be simpler."

936
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,630
And he designs airplane and he ignores the law of gravity.

937
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,380
What kind of airplane machine would he or she design?

A failure.

939
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,590
Aeronautics engineer takes into consideration of reality.

940
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:05,300
And reality-- there's Law of Gravity.

941
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,720
We deal with that.
我们得接受现实

942
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,720
Similarly,what research shows us is reality:

the belief that change is possible.
相信改变是可能的

962

on the society level,why am I doing what I am doing?

972
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,610

it's anything but trivial that change is possible.

00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,740
Let me share with you one study to illustrate what I mean.
下面我用一项研究来说明

975
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,730
The Minnesota Twin study,

00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,320
And what they did was they wanted to understand

979
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,390
how much do genes matter.
基因的重要性

980
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,170
How much is it about nature versus nurture?

981
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,510
So how do you test that?
要如何测试呢?

982
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,540
You look at identical twins,
同卵双胞胎

983
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:42,250
monozygotic twins who share the same genetic profile.
他们拥有相同的基因谱

984
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,600
And you look at those who are reared apart.
研究那些被分开抚养长大的同卵双胞胎

985
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,830
Because if they are reared by the same parents,one could argue,
因为如果他们由相同的父母抚养 人们会说

986
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,990
"Well they came out very similar because same environment:

they look the same; they go to the same schools;

same parents,and so on."

00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,610
but there were quite a few of those exceptions.
但也只有很少例外

1008
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,610

00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:05,410
was that their personality was incredibly similar.

让积极心理学学者 和研究幸福和快乐的人

1011

00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,400
is as futile as trying to be taller

1020
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,100
and is therefore counterproductive."
只会适得其反"

00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,330
This quote made me very unhappy on two accounts.

This wa s a very influential quote.

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,900
where people actually do change
人们的确是会改变的

1038
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,930
and we have research showing that people going to therapy

1039
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,520
very often change as the a result of therapy.
会容易改变

1040
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:51,590
Work by Albert Bandura,Stanford psychologist
斯坦福大学的心理学家Albert Bandura的研究

1041
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:57,530
shows that very often people encountering one special sentence,
表明 人们常因遇到一个特别的句子

1042
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,210
reading it or hearing it from something,

1044
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,630
reading it on certain book,having certain experiences―
在书上读到 或是有某种经历-

1045
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,250
positive or painful experiences C
积极的或痛苦的经历-

1046
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,990
there is this concept of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
有这样一个概念叫做 创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)

1047
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,230
There is also a concept of Post-Traumatic Growth.
还有一种概念叫做 创伤后成长

1048
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,760
So people change-- up or down in their level of happiness
人们的快乐水平会上下变化

1049
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,050
is a result of their experiences.

1050
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,160
So there is counter evidentce that shows that not everyone,
有可靠证据显示 并非每一个人的

1051
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:36,650
level of wellbeing is determined by their genes.
幸福水平都取决于基因

1052
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,240
In fact,there is research
事实上 有研究

1053
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,420
that shows yes genes do matter and they matter a lot,
显示基因很重要 影响甚多

1054
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,930
as we'll talk about during the week on change.
探讨改变的时候我们再谈这问题

1055
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,690
Other things matter as well.
还有其他因素和基因一样重要

1056
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:55,770
And the error that Lykken and Tellegen and many others make
像Lykken和Tellegen那样 人们常错误地

1057
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,800
when they generalize and say "change is not possible"
概括出一个结论 "变化是不可能的"

1058
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,880
is what I call "the error of the average".
我称之为"大众错误"

1059
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,270
Yes,on average,
平均而言

1060
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,140
when you look at this group of 40 or 50 twins reared apart,
当研究这40或50组被分开抚养的双胞胎

1061
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,800
when you look at the average,
大体看来

1062
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,430
they are just about the same.
他们是一样的

1063
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,280
However,that's not looking at the individuals
然而 没有单独来看

1064
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,260
because while many of them are the same,
因为 虽然他们大多数是非常相似的

1065
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,410
not all are the same.
但并不是全部都一样

1066
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,560
It reminds me of a joke about the statistician
这让我想起一个统计学笑话

1067
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:35,080
who drowned in a pool with an average height of 10 inches.
在一个平均水深为10英寸的游泳池里 谁会被淹死

1068
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,700
You see you cannot tell the height or the depth rather
只知道平均值

1069
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,000
of a pool based on the average.
并不知道游泳池的水深

1070
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,170
Because that pool may be average of 10 inches,
由于该池平均10英寸深

1071
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,620
but maybe it has places that are 20 feet deep,
或许它某些区域有20英尺深

1072
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,040
if it's a large pool.
如果它是一个大水池的话

1073
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,830
The same when you look at the average of individuals and twins.
同样 当你平均地看这些双胞胎

1074
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:56,970
The majority on average,they are extremely similar.
大体来说 他们都极其相似

1075
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,080
But there are also outliers.
但也有少数的异常值

1076
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,970
And very often,it's the outliers,
很多时候 这个异常值

1077
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:03,520
the differences that are the most interesting.
这些差异最有趣

1078
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,030
Because they stretch―
因为他们

1079
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,720
not just our imagination-- they stretch our ability to understand
不只延伸了我们的想象 还让我们能理解

1080
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,700
when and where change is possible.
怎样的时间和地点 有可能产生变化

1081
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,610
The question when we see exceptions,
当我们看到了例外-

1082
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:17,590
whether it's the Lykken and Tellegen study,
无论是在Lykken和Tellegen的研究

1083
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,270
where we do see exceptions―
还是别的出现了例外的研究-

1084
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,150
not all twins were the same,
当发现不是所有的双胞胎都一样

1085
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,660
majority were,but not all―
主要的问题

1086
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,630
the question is no longer whether or not change is possible,
已不再是 改变是否有可能

1087
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:32,490
but rather how is change possible.
而是怎样实现这种改变

1088
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,550
Once again,the exception proves the rule.
例外证实了那个规律

1089
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,170
And the research that argues
认为"改变是不可能"的

1090
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,870
that it's not possible to change,is detrimental.
研究是有害的

1091
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,410
Think about an eight year old girl,
设想一个8岁的女孩

1092
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,760
who's very unhappy,
她很忧伤

1093
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:51,340
and then reads some magazine about that study,
然后在杂志上读到那个研究

1094
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:55,310
saying that basically you are genetically set point
研究告诉她 基本上你的基因决定了一切

1095
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,050
what you are born with is there for life.
你与生俱来的一切 将伴随你终生

1096
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,190
She's unhappy.
她会更忧伤

1097
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,710
She feels anxious and miserable as an 8 year old.
她只有8岁 但会觉得非常焦虑与痛苦

1098
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,620
And she says to herself,
她就会想

1099
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,370
"That's it. That's my lot in life. I was born unlucky."
"我的人生就是这样 我生来不幸"

1100
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,710
And that,very often,becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
那很可能会成为一个自我实现的预言

1101
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,720
And she remains unhappy.
她始终不快乐

1102
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,890
Sometimes it even makes her less happy than she was before.
有时这研究让她比以前更不快乐

1103
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,420
Because now she's also helpless.
因为现在她简直是绝望了

1104
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,570
Change is possible.
改变是可能的

1105
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,560
You know I often say that
你知道我经常说

1106
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,710
I am the right the person to teach positive psychology.
我是教积极心理学的最佳人选

1107
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,610
Why?
为什么?

1108
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:35,860
Because I wasn't born with "happy genes".
因为我不是生来就有"快乐基因"

1109
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,060
I was born with,genetically speaking,
从遗传学上讲 我天生就

1110
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:41,400
relatively high level of anxiety,
比较容易焦虑

1111
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,940
inclination toward rumination,
容易得抑郁症

1112
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,810
over-examination―
这是经过测试证实的

1113
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,470
we'll talk about that later in the course.
在后面的课程上我们会谈到

1114
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,960
I went into the positive psychology,
我之所以研究积极心理学

1115
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,410
into the field of psychology,
探索心理学领域

1116
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,020
as I mentioned in the first lecture,
正如我第一节课时提到的

1117
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,000
because I was unhappy here.
是因为我不快乐

1118
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,290
And over time,as a result of many of these studies,
随着时间的推移 出现了很多这类研究

1119
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:08,540
result of examination result of asking also the right questions,
由于提出了正确的问题

1120
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,560
I have become happier.
我变得更快乐

1121
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,870
So on a personal level,I know it's possible to become happier.
个人层面上 是有可能变得更快乐

1122
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,440
Now I am happier today than I was fifteen years ago
现在的我比15年前的我更快乐

1123
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,570
when I started. I hope to be happier 15 years

1124
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,920
from today than I am today.
比今天的我更快乐

1125
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,590
It's a life-long process.
这是个终身的过程

1126
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,070
But it is possible. And many people show that it's possible.
但这是有可能的 很多人证实了这是有可能的

1127
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,510
And those who argue it's not possible
而那些认为这不可能的人

1128
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,230
and use science to argue for that,
他们用科学来争论

1129
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,630
very often,are hurting more than helping the field.
很多时候 只有阻碍作用而毫无帮助

1130
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:43,680
Now by the way Lykken and Tellegen were interviewed
最近Lykken和Tellegen

1131
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,430
recently in TIME magazine issue of happiness.
受到《时代》杂志的采访 谈"快乐"问题

1132
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:53,070
Let me quote to you what they said.
下面是他们说的几句话

1133
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,180
This is in 2005-- Lykken:
2005年 Lykken说

1134
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,320
"I made a dumb statement.
"我作了一个愚蠢的声明

1135
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:04,450
It is clear that we can change happiness levels,up or down."
显然 我们能改变快乐水平 变得更高或更低"

1136
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,360
So they went back on their statement.
于是他们背弃了原来的声明

1137
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,060
It was a sensational statement at the time.
这个声明轰动一时

1138
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,000
It certainly is possible.
改变当然是可能的

1139
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,050
So how do we do research that's more responsible,
我们怎样做更负责任的研究

1140
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:20,390
that does not lead to detrimental results?
怎样杜绝研究产生坏影响?

1141
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,110
And at the same time,true.
同时 研究必须是真实的

1142
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,430
We don't want to invent research.
我们并不是要"发明"研究

1143
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,380
Research is about identifying things
研究的目的在于查明事实

1144
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,590
that really occur/happen in reality.
现实中真正发生了的事实

1145
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,430
So one of the first things that I'll argue for in terms of
首先 我认为在健康研究方面

1146
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:38,620
healthy research is "let's also focus on what is working".
主要的问题是"让我们注重可行的方法"

1147
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,530
That's first thing that we discussed in the past lecture.
这是我们过去探讨过的问题

1148
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,370
The second thing that I will argue for
第二 我认为

1149
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:49,210
in addition to studying what works is also to study the best.
除了要研究可行的方法 还要研究最优秀的个体

1150
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,800
What do I mean by best?
为什么说"最优秀的个体"呢?

1151
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,680
Let's not just study what makes people happy.
我们不但要研究人们因何快乐

1152
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,050
Let's not just study happy people.
不要只是研究快乐的人

1153
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,130
Let's not just study happy relationships and good relationships.
不要只是研究快乐良好的爱情

1154
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,640
Let's study the happiest people.
让我们研究的最快乐的人

1155
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,580
Let's study the most successful relationships
让我们研究最成功的爱情

1156
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,010
and learn from that.
从中学习借鉴

1157
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,260
That is a radically different approach
这是个与大众研究

1158
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,580
than studying just the average.
完全不同的研究方法

1159
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,160
Because what I am saying here is "let's not study the average",
我想说的是 不要研究大众

1160
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,840
let's study the top five percent
研究快乐指数最高的5%的人

1161
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,740
so that we can understand the phenomenon better.
这样就可以更好地理解这一现象

1162
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,050
The person who talks about this is Abraham Maslow.
这就是Abraham Maslow

1163
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,820
When he talked about "growing-tip" statistics.
提出的"成长尖端统计学"

1164
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,810
Let me read to you-- this is taken from his book:
以下这话引自他的书

1165
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,670
"What this kind of research design means
"设计出这类调研是为了

1166
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,070
is a change in our conception of statistics,
改变我们对统计的观念

1167
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,120
and especially of sampling theory.
尤其是对抽样调查的看法

1168
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,910
What I am frankly espousing here
我非常支持

1169
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:55,000
is what I have been calling "growing-tip statistics,"
'成长尖端统计学'

1170
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,170
taking my title from the fact
我的头衔来自以下的研究发现

1171
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,660
that it is at the growing tip of a plant
最优秀的遗传基因会在

1172
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:03,950
that the greatest genetic action takes place."
幼苗的成长尖端出现"

1173
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,250
What he's saying is that
他的意思是

1174
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,460
"let's study the sages,the saints,
"让我们学习圣人

1175
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,860
the extraordinary people,the arrowhead"
非凡的人"

1176
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:17,230
so that we can understand and realize
这样能帮助我们了解

1177
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,900
the potential in all people.
人类的潜能

1178
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,460
Let me quote him in greater length.
我再引述他另一句更长的话

1179
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,030
This is very important,which is why I am doing it:
这话非常重要 是我作这个研究的原因

1180
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,310
"If we want to know how fast a human being can run,
"如果想知道人类最快能跑多快

1181
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:35,180
then it is no use to average out the speed of a "good sample"
那从好的样本中测出平均数是

1182
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,710
of the population;
没用的

1183
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,220
it is far better to collect Olympic gold medal winners
而应该收集田径类奥运冠军的信息

1184
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,730
and see how well they can do.
看他们能跑多快

1185
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,880
If we want to know the possibilities for spiritual growth,
如果想知道心灵成长的可能性

1186
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,490
value growth or moral development in human being,
人类价值增长或道德发展的可能性

1187
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,520
then I maintain that we can learn most
那我认为 我们可以研究

1188
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,510
by studying our most moral,ethical,or saintly people.
最道德或圣洁的人

1189
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:56,770
On the whole I think it fair to say that human history
整体来说 我认为人类历史

1190
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,390
is a record of the ways in which human nuture
是人性逐渐缺失的过程的

1191
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,550
has been sold short.
一个记录

1192
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,290
The highest possibilities of human nature
人性的潜在极限

1193
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,970
have practically always been underrated.
实际上一直被低估了

1194
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,730
Certainly it seems more and more clear that what we call "normal"
显然 我们平常称之为'正常'的东西

1195
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:17,410
in psychology is really a psychopathology of the average,
在心理学上 实际是种大众精神病理

1196
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,970
so undramatic and so widely spread
看上去平平无奇却又非常广泛

1197
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:23,250
that we don't even notice it ordinarily."
我们甚至没有注意到它"

1198
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,650
You see,
你们明白

1199
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:32,580
the implications of what he's saying here?
他话里的含义吗?

1200
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,770
Essentially what he's saying is
基本上 他的意思是

1201
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:39,540
"let's not just study why do most individuals fail;
"不要只研究为什么大多数人失败

1202
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,830
let's also study why do some-- not many―
让我们也研究为什么有些人

1203
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,580
but why do some individuals succeed despite the circumstances".
但为什么有的人尽管条件恶劣也能成功"

1204
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:49,730
Let's not study just the average
不要只研究整体

1205
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,750
that says that people can't really change.
整体看来的话 人是不能改变的

1206
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,930
Let's study those people who have changed,
让我们来研究改变了的人

1207
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,810
who have literally transformed their lives
真的改变了自身生活

1208
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,010
and those lives around them.
和身边其他人生活的人

1209
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,600
This is a radical approach to research.
这是个激进的研究方法

1210
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:08,510
This is a radical approach to the search,
对研究我们自身来说

1211
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,120
to studying ourselves as well.
这也是个激进的方法

1212
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,390
Because very often,if we only study the average,
因为很多时候 如果我们只研究平均水平

1213
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,970
we only see the average,we only see the geometric shapes
那就只会看到平均的结果 只看到几何形状

1214
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:19,760
and completely missed the children on the bus.
完全忽略了汽车上的孩子

1215
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:20,810
And very often,
很多时候

1216
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,230
the answer to some of our most pressing questions
最紧迫的问题的答案

1217
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,020
lies in the extraordinary―
出人意料

1218
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,320
lies on the children on the bus.
就在汽车的孩子身上

1219
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,850
Now does anyone other than me―
除了我还有其他人

1220
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,700
because I admit that I fall into this category―
我承认我属于这一类

1221
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,780
but anyone other than me feel a little bit disease
但有谁在听到我说的这些话时

1222
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,610
when I talk about this?
感到不舒服吗?

1223
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,490
Seriously,a little bit disease when I talk about
说真的 当我谈到

1224
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,220
"let's focus on studying the best―
"让我们集中精力研究最优秀的个体 圣人 非凡的人"

1225
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,560
the saint,the sages,the extraordinary"?
有人感到不舒服吗?

1226
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,360
I feel disease.
我觉得不大舒服

1227
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,310
I'm sure some of you feel that too.
你们有些人应该也有这感觉

1228
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:06,680
Because after all,isn't that elitist?
因为这难道不是精英主义吗?

1229
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,170
Shouldn't we study the average
我们不是应该研究普罗大众吗?

1230
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,740
because we concern not just with elites?
因为我们关心的不只是精英

1231
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,800
We are concerned with the average.
我们关心的是普罗大众

1232
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:20,790
So there are two answers to that―
以下的问题有两个原因

1233
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:25,400
why I still maintain,and I must admit
我为什么还要继续说?我必须承认

1234
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,170
I still feel some disease every time I teach this,
每次教到或想到这个统计

1235
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:32,230
every time I think about this and I think too,
我就觉得有点不舒服

1236
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,440
why it is so important to study the best,
研究最优秀的个体 为什么如此重要

1237
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,450
why the "growing-tip" statistics is
为什么成长尖端统计学

1238
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:40,260
such an important approach to research that I encourage
如此重要 我要建议

1239
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,430
my students to carry out.
大家使用

1240
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,010
First of all,
首先

1241
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,940
because it is not to the exclusion of the average.
因为它不是排除了普罗大众

1242
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:52,740
Just like positive psychology does not say "let's exclude
就像积极心理学不是说 排除不可行的事

1243
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,990
what's not working; let's exclude study of pathology".
排除病理研究"

1244
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,120
Similarly,"growing-tip" statistics is not saying
同样 成长尖端统计学不是提倡

1245
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,570
"let's not study the average".
"我们别研究大众了"

1246
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,740
It says "let's also study the best".
它提倡也去研究最优秀的个体

1247
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,110
So this is the first thing to alleviate the concern of elitism.
因此在这问题上无须计较研究对象是不是精英

1248
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,170
The second issue,the second response is even more important.
第二点 更为重要的是

1249
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,730
Because everyone benefits,when we study the best.
研究最优秀的个体 能让每个人从中受益

1250
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,750
And the "average"-- whatever that means,
而所谓的"大众"

1251
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,710
the "average" benefits even more
在这种研究中

1252
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,240
than the best of this kind of studies.
"大众"比"精英"受益更多

1253
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:34,500
Why?
为什么呢?

1254
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,760
For example: the study of resilience.
例如 对适应力的研究

1255
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:43,550
We could have gone on and studied the average at-risk population
我们本可以继续研究几百年来的

1256
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,570
for decades and centuries.
平均受危人群

1257
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,260
And very little advances would have been made.
应该会取得一点点进展

1258
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,570
Very little advances were made.
事实证明进展甚微

1259
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:54,100
It was only when we started to study
只有当我们开始研究

1260
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:02,300
those "best" examples,those successful kids,
这些"最优秀"的个体 成功的孩子

1261
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:06,160
those "super" kids as they were initially named.
那些"超级"孩子

1262
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,810
It was only when we started to study those
只有当我们开始研究这些

1263
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:14,530
that we actually understood how we can best help that population.
才能了解如何帮助到整体

1264
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,920
And once we applied our studies-- the resilience issue,
只要将心理韧性研究应用到生活中

1265
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,450
everyone benefited and continued to benefit from it.
每个人受益良多

1266
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:25,750
That's an example of "growing-tip" statistics research.
这就是个成长尖端统计学的研究实例

1267
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,190
Or how about the study of meditation?
那关于冥想的研究呢?

1268
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,890
So I want to study how to meditate.
我想研究冥想

1269
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,870

1270
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,720
of sophomores to study meditation?
来研究冥想?

1271
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,820
Or do I go to a mountain top in Tibet

1272
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:42,810
and study the people who have been doing it for decades?
研究冥想了几十年的人?

1273
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,310
Of course I go and study them!
当然我该去研究他们

1274
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,490
This is exactly what psychologists did!
的确有心理学家这样做过

1275
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,610
And they studied their brain―
他们研究了冥想者的大脑

1276
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,010
we'll talk about it when we talk about meditation―
谈到冥想时再谈这问题

1277
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,990
and they illustrated how their brain
通过研究说明他们的大脑

1278
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,240
is transformed through meditation.
如何通过冥想来转换

1279
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,390

were able to take what they learned from these extraordinary,

1282
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,660
best individuals and apply it to other people's lives

1283
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,210
so that now I benefit from meditation
如果我每天冥想15或20分钟

1284
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,910
when I do it for 15 minutes or 20 minutes a day.
就能从中受益

1285
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,860
And millions of other people,"the average",

1286
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:25,620
benefit a great deal because of the study of the best,
因对最优秀的个体的研究

1287
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:26,960
of the "growing-tip".
而受惠

1288
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,090
How about relationships?
那爱情呢?

1289
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,280
Can you imagine

we can learn from it and apply it to our future as well.

1324
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:29,430
When we study our average,we are describing our lives.
