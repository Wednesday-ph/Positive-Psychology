Wonderful to see you here.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,770
I'm teaching this class
我教授这门课是因为

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,620
because I wish a class like this had been taught
在我读本科阶段时

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,050
when I was sitting in your seat as an undergrad here.
非常希望能学习这样一门课程

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,600
This does not mean it is a class you wish to be taught,
可能这门课并不是你希望的那样

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,210
nor does it mean that it is the right class for you.
也可能并不适合你

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,620
But I hope to doing the next couple of lectures is giving you an idea what this class is about
但希望几堂课后 你能有个大概印象

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,110
so that you can decide whether or not it is for you.

I came here in 1992

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,450
And then I had a mini epiphany half way through my sophomore year.
大二期间 突然顿悟了

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,660
I realized that I was in a wonderful place

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,500
with wonderful students around me, wonderful teachers.

00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,200
I was doing well socially.
社交也游刃有余

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Everything was going well.

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,820
Except for the fact.
除了一点

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,250
That I was unhappy.
我不快乐

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,250
And I didn't understand why.
而且我不明白为什么

24
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,460
It was then in a matter of moments,
也就是在那时

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,170
that I decided that I had to find out why and become happier.
我决定要找出原因 变得快乐

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,260
And that was when I switched my concentration
于是我将研究方向

27
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,190
from computer science to philosophy and psychology
从计算机科学转向了哲学及心理系

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,570
with a single question:
目标只有一个

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,290
how can I become happier?
如何变得更快乐?

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,550
Over time I did become happier.

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,390
What contributed most to my happiness was when I encountered a new emerging field
主要因为我接触了一个新的领域

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,050
that at that time didn't have the name that it has today.

33
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,930
But essentially research that falls under or within the field of positive psychology.
但本质上属于积极心理学范畴

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,380
Positive psychology, studying it,
研究积极心理学

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,830
applying the ideas to my life has made me significantly happier.

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,620
It continues to make me happier.
而且这种快乐继续着

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,270
And it was when I realized the impact that it had on me that I decided to share it with others.
于是我决定将其与更多的人分享

38
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,260
That's when I decided that I wanted to be a teacher and teach in this field.
选择教授这门学科

39
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,830
So this is positive psychology,
这就是积极心理学

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,340
psychology 1504.
1504号心理学课程

relatively new and fascinating field.

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,280
And hopefully, we will be exploring more than the field ourselves.

44
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,980
When I first taught this class that was back in 2002,
我第一次开设这门课程 是在2002年

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,920

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,140

48
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,510
The year after,
一年后

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
the class became slightly larger.
学生稍微多了一点

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,860
I had over three hundred students.
有300多人参加

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,680
And then third year when I taught it which was the last time,
到了第三年 也就是上一次开课

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,960
I had 850 students in the class,

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,720
making it at that point the largest course at Harvard.
是当时哈佛人数最多的课程

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,280
And that's when the media became interested.
这引起了媒体的关注

55
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,180
Because they wanted to understand why.
因为他们想知道为什么

56
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,350
They wanted to understand this phenomenon that "here you have a class,
他们对这一奇特现象非常好奇

57
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,390
that's larger than Introduction to Economics".
"竟然有比经济学导论更热门的课程

58
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,830
How could that be?
怎么可能呢?"

59
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,770
So I was invited by the media for interviews,
于是我被请去参加各类媒体采访

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,330
whether it was newspapers, radio, television.
报纸 广播 电视

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,750
And I started to notice a pattern during those interviews.
从这些采访中 我发现了一种有趣的模式

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,740
So I would walk into the interview.
我前去参加采访

63
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,200
We would have the interview.
进行采访

64
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,080
And afterwards, the producer or the interviewer would walk me out
结束后 制片人或主持人会送我出来

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,620
and say something to the effects of "well thank you Tal for the interview.
说些诸如"Tal 多谢你抽空参加采访

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,970
But you know I expected you to be different".
"不过你跟我想象的不太一样"的话

67
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,120
And I would ask, as nonchalant as I could of course.
我漫不经心地问

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,070
I didn't really care but had to ask anyway,
我无所谓 不过总得回应

69
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,950
"how different?" And they would say,
"有何不同?" 他们会说

70
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,900
"Well you know, we expected you to be more outgoing."
"这个嘛 我们以为你很外向"

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,090
Next interview, the end of the interview, same thing.
下一次采访 结束时仍是如此

72
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,350
"Thank you for doing the interview.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,170
But you know Tal, I expected you to be different."

74
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,280
And once again, nonchalant of course.
又一次 我漫不经心地问

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,770
would ask"how different?"
"有何不同?"

76
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,170
And she would say,
她说

77
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,440
"Well you know, we expected you to be less, less itrovert."

78
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,410

"Well, you know, more extroverted. More outgoing."

81
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,530
Next interview. "Well, you know, less shy."
下一次采访 "这个嘛 太害羞了"

82
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,530
Coz I get very nervous in interviews.
因为采访中我容易紧张

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,330
Interview after interview, literally dozens.
差不多有几十次采访

84
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,020
More outgoing, more cheerful.
每次都是"好交际 更开朗"

Less introverted, more extroverted.

86
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,460
And on and on.
诸如此类

87
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,530
But here is the best one.
最绝的一次

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,060
So this is one of the local channels here around Boston.

which I thought was actually pretty good.
我觉得进行得不错

92
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,080
And at the end of the interview,
采访结束

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,200
the interviewer is a very jolly guy.

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,370
He walks me out and puts his hands on my shoulder,

and says, "thank you very much for doing the interview."

96
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,240
And then the usual comes.
然后又是那句

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,550
"But you know Tal, I expected you to be different."
"不过 Tal 你跟我想象得不太一样"

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,230
And I said,
我问

99
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,750
"How different?" Just so you understand,
"有何不同" 你要知道

100
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,350
by this time, my self-esteem is short.
那时候 我已经完全被打击了

101
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,130
But still with some resemblance of nonchalance I asked,
不过我还是漫不经心地问

102
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,320
"how different?"
"有何不同?"

103
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,200
And he looks at me and says,
他看着我说

104
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,630
"Well I don't know Tal. I expected you to be taller."

Taller? What?
更高些?什么?

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,660
Five seven, well ok five six and a half is not enough to teach happiness?
1米70...是1米69不够格传授快乐吗

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,040
And I thought about it. I thought about it a lot.
我考虑了很久 仔细思量了

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,330
The whole pattern from the beginning.
整件事从头到尾

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,280
And I think I understand why they expected someone different.
我似乎明白为什么他们期望不同了

110
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,480
You see they had to explain to themselves as well as the audience,
因为他们要说服自己 说服观众

111
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,420
"how come this lecture is larger than the Introduction to Economics?"
"这门课怎么会比经济学导论更热门?"

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,960
And the way to explain it must be that
唯一的解释就是

113
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,470
the teacher is very outgoing,
导师非常外向

114
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,010

very cheerful and extrovert and of course, tall.

116
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,470
Well, there is one L missing there.
可惜我的名字少了一个L

117
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,260
But...
但是

118
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,250
Yeah.
是啊

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,740
If only.
真可惜

120
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,760
So the problem though is
所以问题是

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,650
that they were looking in the wrong place for the explanation.
他们找答案找错了地方

122
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,020
In other words, they were looking at the messenger.
也就是说 他们不该关注信息传达者

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,940
What they needed to look at was the message.
而应该关注信息本身

124
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,930
Now how do I know that?
我怎么知道的呢

125
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,380
You see because I see other positive psychology classes on other campuses

140
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:21,220
on happiness, on well-being has been until recently dominated by the self-health movement.

What do we have in the self-health movement?
心理自助运动带来了什么

142

147

But, there is a very big "but" here.

148
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,990
Many of these books, many of these workshops and seminars lack substance.
其中许多书籍讨论都缺少实质内容

149
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,160
Very often, overpromising and under-delivering.
通常都言过其实 无法兑现

153
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,620
Overpromising. Under-delivering.
夸大其词 效果甚微

154
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,310
On the other hand, we have academia.
再来说说学术界

What do we have in academia?

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,020
But, and there is also a very big "but" here.
但是 又有一个大大的转折

160
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,770
Very few people read refereed academic journals.
很少有人会阅读专业学术期刊

161
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,110
I mean Think about it: how many people outside this room of course

have read the last twelve issues of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology?

Most people don't even know what that means.
大多数人甚至不知道那是什么东西

164
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,980
The head of my PHD programs actually estimated the average academic journal article

165

is read by seven people.

And that includes the author's mother.

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,270
So you know I say half in jest but it's actually really sad.

169
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,130
Because...certainly sad for me, as an academic.

171
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,530

can even make more of a difference.

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,990
But not accessible to most people.
但是对大众来说晦涩难懂

175
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,720
And this is where positive psychology comes in.
所以我们需要积极心理学

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,420
And this is also where this class comes in.
需要这门课程

177
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,750
The explicit mandate of positive psychology as well as of this class

178
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,440
is to create a bridge between Ivory tower and mainstreet.

179
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,460
In other words, it is to bring the rigor,
换句话说 就是要把严谨

180
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,080
the substance, the empirical foundation,
实质 经验基础

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,280
the science from academia

But then it will also be taught at the second level,

I did not just introduce whether it's in the readings or in the lectures ideas

204
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,580
just because they are interesting for the sake of the idea.

Just a few words about housekeeping.

Some of the questions that I have already received from you before the class started.

there will be positive psychology class offered,

Sometimes if the question is asked by enough people,

Unless you specified specifically that your name can be mentioned.

In that case, please just put your hand up.

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,120
Coz it's just like when you have to go to the bathroom.

you gotta go.
就去

232
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,410
So we'll take a positive psychology break for that.
我们会为此进行积极心理休息

233
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,090
And just stop me half way through and I'll answer any question.
所以大可以打断我 我会回答任何问题

234
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,780
All the power points, as well as the videos of the classes will be online.
所有幻灯片以及课程视频都会放在网上

235
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,270
Will be available within couple of days.

236
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,440
Well the power points will be available before,
幻灯片其实课前就能下载

237
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,920
say for this lecture it will be before so that you can use them in class.
这样你上课时就能用到

238
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,320
The videos, unfortunately, cannot be made available before. We tried.
可惜视频不能提前提供 我们试了

239
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
Couldn't figure it out.
但效果不好

240
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,090
So it will be available within a day or two after.
所以会在课后一两天内放到网上

241
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,280
And the reason why they are up there.
这样做的原因

242
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,500
First of all, I do prefer that you attend lecture.

243
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,650
I do prefer that you are physically here.
能出现在课堂里

244
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,350
You get things in the energy of the room with so many students
和大家一起 在课堂的气氛中学习

245
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,290
so you wouldn't just get from your computer.
而不是仅仅对着电脑

246
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,570
The reason why I do put them up is so that you have the opportunity
我之所以把资料放在网上是为了

247
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,470
if you want to see it again or if you have to miss a class.
让你们可以重温或者学习错过的课程

248
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,610
That's perfectly fine.
这很正常

249
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,040
And also because,
另一个原因

250
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,800
and this is also the reason why the power points are always available,
之所以提前提供幻灯片

251
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,530
I want you to be engaged in the material.
我希望你们能充分理解材料

252
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,550
I want you to be engaged in whatever it is that we are discussing in class.
充分参与课堂讨论

253
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,350
Not necessarily thinking about getting down every word that I say on paper,
而不是忙于记录我说的每一个字

254
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,010
remembering everything, memorizing everything.
记住每一个词 背诵每一句话

255
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,180
I want you to take rather than passive notes of writing down
我不希望你们被动地记录

256
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,790
what is on the power point or every word that I say.
幻灯片上的内容或者我说的话

257
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,340
I'd like you to take active notes.
而是要主动记录

258
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,890
And that means being engaged with the material.
也就是要充分理解材料

259
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,620
For example, if you heard something and idea and you say,
比如 如果你们听到某个理论 觉得

260
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,150
"Oh, that's interesting."
"挺有趣的"

261
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,680
Star it. Write it down.
标上星号 写下来

262
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,320
Or "Ok I think I'll start applying this."
或者觉得"也许我可以应用这点"

263
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,810
Write it down.
那就写下来

264
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,590
"Or I want to tell my mom about this later."
或者"跟我妈妈讲讲"

265
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,050
Or "I want to talk to my roommates or my team about this idea."
或者"跟我室友队友讲讲"

266
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,780
Write it down.
那就写下来

267
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,530
Active note-taking is opposed to passive note-taking for two reasons.
主动笔记与被动笔记有两方面不同

268
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,300
First of all, as I said,
首先 正如我刚才说的

269
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,030
this class is a class about making a difference in people's lives.
这门课是关于如何改变生活

270
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,530
I would not be teaching the class just for its academic beauty,
我不会仅为了学术之美而教授此课

271
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,520
although there is a lot of academic beauty in this field.
虽然这一领域的确有许多学术之美

272
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,440
So write down if you have an idea that you think you can apply.
所以发现可以实际运用的 就写下来

273
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,310
The second reason why we should that is because you'll remember more.
第二个原因是 你会记住更多

274
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,880
Better attention, better understanding of the material if you are actively engaged,
主动参与 集中注意 更好地理解材料

275
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,360
as opposed to just taking down passive notes.
而不是被动做笔记

276
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,340
Throughout the class,
在这整个课程中

277
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,970
starting next week,
从下周开始

278
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,650
we'll take what I called,
我们将进行我所说的

279
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,960
"time-ins" as opposed to "time-outs".
"练习时间" 而不是"休息时间"

280
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,370
it's like a time-out.
其实类似"休息时间"

281
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,100
It's the time where we stop the class and you look inward.
这段时间会我们停止课程 进行内省

282
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,650
And this is literally a time of silence in a class.
也就是课堂上的安静时刻

283
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,350
I will stop for a minute or two.
我会停一两分钟

284
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:58,120
And you'll have a chance either to just stare at me or anyone else,
你们可以盯着我或者周围人发呆

285
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,170
or think about what we've just discussed,
或者思考一下之前讨论的内容

286
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:07,340
or have a guiding question that I will provide you that you'll address during the class.
或者解答我提出的提示问题

287
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,580
The reason why I have "Time-ins"...
之所以进行"练习时间"

288
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,530
This is something that I am introducing this year for the first time.
这是今年新提出的

289
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,300
We didn't have it last time.
上学期并没有

290
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,360
It's because over the last two years since I last taught it,
因为上次课程结束后到现在的两年

291
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,630
I've done a lot work in the area of silence.
我做了大量关于安静的研究

292
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:27,390
I've read a lot of research in this area about the importance of quiet times whether it's in a class,
关于安静时刻的重要性 无论是课堂里

293
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,540
in a lecture, whether it is at home,
讲座里 还是家中

294
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,750
whether it is for a leader in the business,
无论是对公司领导

295
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,520
for relationship, for children starting from pre-schools.
爱情关系 甚至学龄前儿童

296
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,450
Now many of you,
你们中很多人

297
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,750
as you are going through these "time-ins" if you decide to take this class may think,
在经历"练习时间"时可能会疑惑

298
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,430
"Well, is this what I'm paying 40,000 dollars a year for?
"我一年付四万美金就是为了这个?"

299
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,310
To sit a class and be quiet?"
"坐在教室里发呆?"

300
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,720
First of all, it will only be a minute or two at a time,
首先 每次只有一两分钟

301
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,970
maybe once or twice a lecture.
一堂课最多不超过两次

302
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,110
But second,
第二 这可能是

303
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,360
it is maybe the most important thing you'll take from this class.
你从本课程中学到的最重要的东西

304
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,810
The notion of embracing stillness.
即享受安静这一理念

305
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,990
Let me read to you an excerpt from a study that was run by two MIT professors.
我来读一段麻省理工两位教授的研究

306
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,960
By the way, all the names that I read and that are not on the power points,
我所提到名字不会出现在幻灯片上

307
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,750
you don't need to remember or write down.
不必背诵或记录

308
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,790
This is just for your edification.
只是为了启发你们

309
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,210
So David Foster and Matthew Wilson.
David Foster和Matthew Wilson教授

310
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,440
Both of them are from MIT.
都来自麻省理工大学

311
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,210
Indeed the following study that I think confirms the importance of "time-in",
他们研究证实了"练习时间"的重要性

312
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,770
time to look inside.
开始内省的时间

313
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,700
What they did is they scanned the brains of rats
他们在老鼠处在迷宫中及脱离迷宫后

314
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,510
while they were in a maze and after they went through the maze.
分别对它们进行了脑扫描

315
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,970
And here's what they found.
以下是他们的发现

316
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,520
"What the results suggest is that while there certainly is some record of your experience
实验结果表明 当某种经历正在进行时

317
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,390
as it is occurring. in other words when they were doing the maze,
即老鼠进行迷宫时

318
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,880
the actual learning C
真正的学习阶段

319
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,140
when you try to figure out:
是当你尝试分辨

320
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,550
'What was important? What should I keep and throw away?'
什么才是重要的 什么舍弃什么保留

321
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,960
C that happens after the fact,
这些发生在经历之后

322
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,820
during periods of quiet wakeful introspection.
进行安静的自省时

323
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,380
What they show was rats who went through the maze
他们的实验表明

324
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,400
and went through the maze again and again,
接连不断反复进入迷宫的老鼠

325
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,090
learned far less than rats who took time aside,
比进行一次迷宫后

326
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,140
chilled out a little bit after a maze,
稍事放松 来点小酒的老鼠

327
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,280
had more margarita.
学到的少得多

328
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,030
Experience, embrace stillness.
经历 享受安静

329
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,930
This has implications and they showed implications to human beings as well.
这很能说明问题 对人类也一样

330
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,790
Not only those of the rat race,
不仅仅是实验小白鼠

331
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,380
all human beings.
所有人类都是

332
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:44,240
So what they say is that "replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory".
他们认为"重现可能形成一种学习记忆机制"

333
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
Both learning, understanding,
包括学习 理解

334
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,160
as well as memory, retention.
记忆 保留

335
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,120
When we reflect, when we replay the material,
当我们思考时 我们重放素材时

336
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,830
we are much more likely to retain,
更容易保留

337
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,190
to remember what we have just been through.
记住之前的经历

338
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,320
So the importance of time aside cannot be over-emphasized.
所以休息时间的重要性不能被忽视

339
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,250
In his wonderful book of teaching,
Parker Palmer在他的教学著作

340
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,690
Parker Palmer-- it's called The Courage to Teach,
《教学的勇气》一书中

341
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,440
says the following--
提到了以下一段话

342
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,850
Words are not the sole medium of exchange in teaching and learning.
语言不是教学的唯一媒介

343
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,300
We educate with silence as well.
安静同样可以进行教育

344
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,650
Silence gives us a chance to reflect on what we have said and heard.
安静让我们有机会反省我们所说所闻

345
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,750
In authentic education,
在真正的教育中

346
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,580
silence is treated as a trustworthy matrix for the inner work students must do,
安静为学生进行内省提供可靠环境

347
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,960
a medium for learning of the deepest sort."
是一种最深层次的学习媒介

348
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,490
Silence is something that is missing from our culture.
而安静恰恰是我们文化所缺失的

349
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,670
I know that many of you have probably read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
很多人可能读过《万里任禅游》

350
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,390
Robert M. Pirsig.
作者Robert M Pirsig

351
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,960
He had a second book out,
还写过另一本书

352
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,090
less well-known, called Lila (Lila: an Inquiry into Morals).
没那么知名 叫《寻找莱拉》

353
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,330
And Lila is an anthropological study of Native Americans.
这本书是对印第安人的人类学研究

354
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:04,850
What he does there is compare their culture to Americans' from European ancestry.
将他们的文化与美国传承的欧洲文化进行对比

355
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,000
And one of the distinguishing characteristics between these two cultures
两种文化最突出的特点之一是

356
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,640
is their approach were silence.
印第安人崇尚安静

357
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,350
What he found was when he went and sat around with Native Americans.
他发现和印第安人坐在一起

358
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,230
They would sit around the fire and hang out for two,
他们围坐在篝火边两三个小时

359
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,540
three hours without saying a word.
一句话也没说

360
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,540
Just sit around.
只是坐在那儿

361
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,740
Look at one another.
看着对方

362
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,460
Smile. Have a good time.
微笑 享受美好时光

363
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,760
Introspect.
内省

364
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Just be there for hours.
就这样几个小时

365
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,950
While he points out that in our culture we feel very uncomfortable with the absence of words,
他指出 在我们文化中沉默

366
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,120
with the absence of sound or noise.
让人不适

367
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,400
We have to fill up all the gaps.
我们试图打破沉默

368
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,990
This is an important cultural difference.
这是一项重要的文化差异

369
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,110
And we pay a price for this lack of stillness.
我们为缺乏安静付出了代价

370
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,200
A price that we'll talk about a lot,
我们会重点讨论这一代价

371
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,430
when I talk about relationships,
涉及到恋爱

372
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,760
when I talk about virtue and morality
美德与道德

373
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,960
and when we talk about happiness and wellbeing in general.
以及快乐与幸福感

374
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,200
Let me give a little bit background on positive psychology:
下面介绍一下积极心理学的背景

375
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,120
how we came about and how this class came about.
它是如何诞生的 这门课是如何诞生的

376
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,120
In many ways, positive psychology is the brainchild,
从很多方面来说 积极心理学是

377
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,200
the product and the grandchild of humanistic psychology.
人本主义心理学的产物和衍生

378
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,660
What we have in humanistic psychology is essentially a reaction
人本主义心理学本质上是

379
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,070
to the existing psychologies of the time.
对当时各种心理学派系的不同意见

380
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,520
The founders, considered the founders of humanistic psychology
人本主义心理学的创始人

381
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,390
in fact called it "the third force".
称之为心理学上的"第三势力"

382
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,380
Why the "third force"?
为什么是"第三势力"

383
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,390
Because the first force was behaviorism.
因为第一势力是行为主义

384
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,650
The work of Skinner (B. F. Skinner),
代表人物有斯金纳

385
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,350
the work of Watson (John B. Watson),
华生

386
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,120
the work of Thorndik (Edward Thorndik).
桑代克

387
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,310
This was the first force.
这是第一势力

388
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,990
The second force was psychoanalysis.
第二势力是精神分析学

389
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,040
The work of Freud (Sigmund Freud), Jung (Carl Jung), Adler (Alfred Adler) to some extent.
创建者包括弗洛伊德 荣格以及阿德勒

390
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,340
This was the second force.
这是第二势力

391
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,530
And the third force,
第三势力

392
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,720
humanistic psychology came as a reaction to it.
人本主义心理学作为对其的异议出现

393
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,600
First it is a reaction to behaviorism.
首先是对行为主义的异议

394
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,310
Behaviorism looks at the human entity,
行为主义认为人的主体性

395
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,450
at the person as basically a collection of behaviors as a box,
认为人是一个行为集合

396
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,770
like a billiard ball knocked around by reinforcements,
就像一只被击打而四处滚动的台球

397
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,400
by punishment, by reward.
被增强 奖惩驱动

398
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,480
And what humanistic psychology said was that
而人本主义心理学认为

399
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,460
we are much more than a billiard ball being knocked around.
我们不只是被击打的台球

400
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,410
We have spirit. We have a soul.
我们有精神 有灵魂

401
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,800
We have cognitions and thoughts that matter.
我们有重要的认知与思想

402
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,430
It's not just behavior that is important for understanding as well as improving life.
不能只靠行为观察 改善人生

403
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,210
And then psychoanalysis, the second force.
然后是第二势力精神分析学

404
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:12,060
The psychoanalysis is about basically understanding mostly through the subconscious:
精神分析学主要通过潜意识分析

405
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,110
that's how you understand it;
它决定你的理解

406
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,050
that's how you improve the quality of life.
决定如何改善生活

407
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,380
There are defense mechanisms,
还有防卫机制

408
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,480
there are biological instincts, neurosis--
人类本能论 神经症

409
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,660
and if you understand these very often dark forces,
如果你理解这些黑暗势力

410
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,940
were better able to deal with life:
就能更好地处理生活

411
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,140
understand as well as improve the quality of life.
了解并改善生活质量

412
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
Humanistic psychology says human beings are much more than that.
人本主义心理学认为人类不止如此

413
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,220
Much more than biological instincts,
不仅仅是生理本能

414
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,280
much more than neurosis,
不仅仅是神经症

415
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:48,270
much more than the person who exists in a Newtonian reality like a billiard ball.
不仅仅是牛顿学说世界里的台球

416
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,840
We need to value much more the human being.
我们要重视人的本质

417
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:00,320
We need to give much more dignity and freedom to the person.
给予人更多的自尊和自由

418
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,250
There was a problem.
但有一个问题

419
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,250
The problem was humanistic psychology is said lacked the rigorous methodology.
人本主义心理学缺少严谨的方法论

420
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,980
While it brought in many wonderful ideas,
但它引入了许多精彩的理念

421
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,790
talked about the study of well-being,
对于幸福感的研究

422
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,220
talked about the study of optimism,
乐观主义的研究

423
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,630
of kindness, of morality, of virtue,
善良 道德 美德

424
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,630
of love, of relationships, of peak experiences,
爱 两性关系 巅峰体验

425
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,600
of self-actualization, of empathy.
自我实现 移情

426
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,480
All these wonderful concepts that we'll talk about throughout the semester.
这些精彩的概念都会在本学期探讨

427
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,140
It wasn't as rigorous about its epistemology,
它的认识论并不严谨

428
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,590
about how we form ideas and how we learn.
如何形成理念 如何学习

429
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,500
And that's why, in many ways, largely,
所以在很多方面 大部分

430
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,130
not completely but largely more of into the self-health movement.
不完全但大部分成为了自助运动

431
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,310
Interesting ideas, good ideas, important ideas,
有趣 有益 重要的理念

432
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,060
certainly good intentions,
意图当然是好的

433
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,130
but to some extent,
但就某种程度上

434
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,890
without the academic rigor.
缺乏学术严谨性

435
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,180
And that's why it lacked the impact on academia.
所以它在学术上影响很小

436
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,870
That's why we don't have partly any humanistic psychology classes offered in universities today.
所以很少有大学开设人本主义心理学

437
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,840
There are very few still around.
几乎没有

438
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,910
And this is why also a lot of it became the New Age essentially.
所以本质上成为了新纪元运动

439
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,110
But still,
但是

440
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:12,030
it's humanistic psychology that has in many ways fathered and mothered,
我们很快会了解到 人本主义心理学

441
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,490
as we'll see, positive psychology.
孕育了积极心理学

442
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,290
So let's meet the grandparents.
然我们先见见祖父祖母

in the next half an hour and so,

a sense of what you expect in this class.
我会向你们介绍下这门课的内容

529
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,480
The first thing is this class is not just about information,
首先 这门课不光是传授信息

530
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,850
it is also explicitly about transformation.
而且关于如何变形 显而易见

531
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,320
What do I mean by that?
这是什么意思

532
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,070
You see most of education today is about information.
如今大多数教育都只是传达信息

533
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,610
What is information?
什么是信息

534
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,610
So we have a container,
比如 我们有一个容器

535
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,720
which is our mind.
也就是我们的思想

536
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,230
And information is about taking data,
信息就是接收数据

537
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:56,870
taking science, taking information and putting it inside the form.
接收科学 接收信息 储存到容器里

538
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,230
That is information.
这就是信息

539
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,460
Now when this form is filled,
等容器填满了

540
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,280
that's when we are educated.
我们就毕业了

541
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,170
More information, more data, better.
信息数据越多越好

542
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,780
Not enough.
这还不够

543
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,660
Because it's not just information that determines our wellbeing,

544

our success, our self-esteem, our motivational level,

545
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,650
the relationship and the quality of our relationships.

546
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,920
It's much more than information.
光有信息还不够

547
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:36,300
Transformation is about taking this form and changing it.
变形则是把容器的形状改变

548
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,130
Trans, (which is) change, form, (which is) shape.
"trans"即改变 "form"即形状

549
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,520
Change the form.
改变形状

550
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,170
This is transformation.
这就是变形

551
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,840
This is the distinction that I learned first from at the school Professor Robert Kegan
这是Robert Kegan教授

552
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,390
who taught about this.
教我的第一区别

553
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,550
Information in and of itself is not enough.
接收信息 关注信息本身是不够的

554
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,930
Think about this example.
听听这个例子

I just failed.
我彻底失败了

562

You feel deflated. Enervated.
你灰心丧气 感到无力

563
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,110
On the other hand,
但从另一角度看

00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,680
the exact same event.
同样的比赛

565
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,480
You came eight when you expected to be top three.
你期望获得前三 但只得到第八

566
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,040
You can interpret it as "Ok, so what have I learned?

567
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,670
I need to work even harder."

You learned from the experience.
从经验中学习

570

In other words, the same objective information which is

Or think about another very common example.

590
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,490
It's also the shape,

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,550
This is what I realized when I was an undergrad here.
这是我在本科生阶段所认识到的

594
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,260
Seemingly, looking in from the outside, I had everything.
表面上看 我拥有了一切

595
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,280
Doing well (in) sports,
体育运动

596
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,390
academics and socially.
学术 社交都很成功

597
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,010
And yet my perception,
但是我对生命的理解

598
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,690
my focus, my interpretation of life-- not that great.
关注和解读并不正面

599
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,960
I wasn't happy.
我不快乐

600
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:17,660
The interpretation matters very often a lot more as we'll see than the information that goes in.
我们后面会讲 通常解读比信息更重要

601
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,110
One of the sentences that I'll repeat throughout the class is that
有一句话我会在课程中经常引用

602
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:30,810
happiness is much more contingent on our state of mind than our status or the state of our bank account.
快乐由我们的精神状态而定 而不是社会地位或银行存款

603
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,830
And that's where transformation comes in.
所以需要变形

604
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,610
And that's why it's so important for wellbeing.
这对建立幸福感来说很重要

605
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,510
What that will look like in practice
所以我们在实际操作时

606
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,670
is that we'll cover not so much information.
不会传达过多信息方面的东西

607
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,500
We'll uncover much more and I don't mean that in the Berkeley (George Berkeley) sense of the word.
而是挖掘更多东西 不是联想意义上的

608
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,850
I mean that in the academic sense of the word.
而是学术意义上的

609
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,290
In other words,
也就是说

610
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,240
what we'll do is uncover potential that we have inside,
我们要挖掘自身潜能

611
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
that we have inside of us all along.
这种潜能一直存在

612
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,390
Maybe we just didn't see.
只是我们没有发现

613
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,440
Or maybe it's obscured by something or another.
或者被其他东西掩盖了

614
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,620
We'll uncover it so that we can utilize it,
我们要发现利用它

615
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,310
so that we can focus on it,
以便关注它

616
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,090
so that we can perceive it.
以便理解它

617
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,450
Here is a story just to illustrate it.
我讲个故事来说明吧

618
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,970
So this is Michelangelo.
比如米开朗基罗

619
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,330
One day he was asked by a journalist of his time,
曾经有个记者问他

620
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,490
"how did you create this most amazing masterpiece, David?",
您是如何创造出《大卫》这件巨作的?

621
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,180
to which Michelangelo responded,
米开朗基罗回答

622
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,670
"it was easy.
很简单

623
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,390
I went to the quarry.
我去了趟采石场

624
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,800
I saw this huge piece of marble.
看见一块巨大的大理石

625
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,550
And in it I saw David.
我在它身上看到了大卫

626
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:58,000
All I needed to do was to chip away the excess stone,
我只要凿去多余的石头

627
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,540
to get rid of the marble that shouldn't have been there.
只留下有用的

628
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,490
And when I got rid of this excess stone, there was David.
凿去多余的石头之后 大卫就诞生了

629
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,850
" Not obviously easier said than done.
虽然说的比做的容易

630
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:16,030
But the story captured the metaphor of what this class very much is about.
但是这个故事抓住了这门课程精髓

631
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,760
It's about chipping away the excess stone.
即凿除多余石块

632
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers,
也就是摆脱限制 阻碍

633
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,070
whether it's the fear of failure,
或者对失败的恐惧

634
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,430
something that we didn't have as kids.
这些东西在并不是与生俱来的

635
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,870
But today most people in our culture have it.
但如今却出现在了大多数人身上

636
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:35,290
It's about chipping away perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us.
要凿除削弱甚至伤害我们的完美主义

637
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:42,600
It's about chipping away our ability for success,
凿除胜利的能力

638
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,040
because maybe we are afraid of success.
因为我们可能害怕胜利

639
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,260
Maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life,
可能对生命中一些东西感到内疚

640
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,460
and that in turn limits us.
这些都会反过来限制我们

641
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,610
Maybe it's about chipping away the limitations on our relationships
也许甚至还要凿除两性关系中的限制

642
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,600
in while we don't thrive within them.
尤其是带来消极面的时候

643
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,530
This is what this class is mostly about.
这些就是本课程的主要内容

644
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,360
As Thoreau says,
就像梭罗说的那样

645
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:13,240
"soul grows more by subtraction than by addition",
"做减法比做加法让灵魂成长得更快"

646
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,710
by getting rid of these limitations,
减法包括除去那些

647
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,040
limitations that are preventing us from fulfilling our potential.
阻碍我们发挥潜能的限制

648
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,250
Because our potential is in there in nature.
因为我们的潜能是天生的

649
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,380
We talk a lot about human nature.
我们关注人类本性

650
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,810
It's there whether it's through God,
是与生俱来的 无论是上帝赐予的

651
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,630
whether it's through evolution.
还是进化产生的

652
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,810
We have a lot of potential that over time with we fix (?) stone of voices with being part of our culture
但是渐渐地受到外部文化压力

653
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,110
that very often these limitations are put on top of us just like the excess stone.
像多余石料一样 把我们禁锢起来了

654
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,360
Lao Tzu, "In pursuit of knowledge every day something is acquired.
老子说过

655
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,880
In pursuit of wisdom,
"为学日益

656
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,490
every day something is dropped."
为道日损"

657
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,420
Knowledge is about information.
"学"即信息

658
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,860
Wisdom is about transformation.
"道"即变形

659
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:12,930
I was recently interviewed for a newsletter on coaching
我最近参加一次大型咨询业会议时

660
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,240
before a large conference on the topic.
接受了一家相关期刊的采访

661
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,710
And the interviewer asked me,
采访者问我

662
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,510
"So what tips, what tools can you give from positive psychology?"
"能给读者传授些积极心理学建议吗"

663
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,340
So I talked about some of "the greatest hits":
于是我谈到了一些热门话题

664
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,930
the importance of gratitude,
感恩的重要性

665
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,860
the importance of physical exercise.
体育锻炼的重要性

666
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,090
I talked about the importance of spending time on our relationships,
我谈到了花时间经营爱情的重要性

667
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,400
about taking time aside and simplifying and so on and so on.
谈到了休息 简化 等等

668
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,330
As I was going through my long list,
我正滔滔不绝时

669
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,210
she stopped me and she said,
她打断了我 说

670
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,710
"You know Tal, this is all good.
谢谢 Tal 这些都不错

671
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,910
The importance of stuff, I know.
那些事情的重要性 我明白

672
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,150
But our readers already know that.
但这些我们的读者都已经知道了

673
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,450
I am looking for the Wow factor.
我想要的是轰动的因素

674
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,080
Come on, surprise me.
能让我意外的东西

675
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,860
What can you tell our readers?"
能否告诉我们的读者?"

676
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,270
And I thought about this question for a minute
我想了一会这个问题

677
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:03,270
and I realized that there is no Wow.
然后意识到根本没有什么惊奇可言

678
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,180
And I told her that,
我跟她这么说了

679
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,470
"you know if there is a wow, the wow is that there is no wow."
"所谓的轰动之处就是没有轰动之处"

680
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
That's it.
就是这样

681
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,800
Because the over-not-transformation emperor,
因为没有经过转变

682
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,300
the emperor of quick fixes has no clothes.
快速见效的说法都是皇帝的新衣

683
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,750
It doesn't exist.
是不存在的

684
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,120
it's over-promising and under-delivering.
是过高的承诺和过低的兑现

685
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,250
A life, a fulfilling life,
生活 令人满意的生活

686
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,190
a rich life includes ups and downs,

as we'll talk about next week.

692
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,260
It's not about this one secret.
而不是关乎一个秘密

693
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,510
One Wow to the good life.
一个能让人过上幸福生活的令人惊奇的诀窍

694
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,630
And many of the things you will learn in this class,
而你们将在本课程中学到的许多东西

695
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,870
you've heard of before.
都是你们之前听说过的

696
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,030
Probably nothing new to you.
也许对你来说没有什么新鲜的内容

697
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,100
You already know it inside of you.
在你内心深处你已经知道了

00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,970
And you are going to say, "Well, it is common sense."

699
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,370
And yes, a lot of it is common sense.

700
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,740

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,840
And this especially applies to application.

00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:19,120
So the aim of this class is to make common sense more common,

704
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,360
especially in the real world application.

At the end of the semester,

I don't think-- I am not expecting you to come and tell me,

"Wow! Thank you for teaching me so many new things."

That's not what I am expecting.

713
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,150
I don't think that is what will happen.
我不认为那会发生

714
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,640
What I hope will happen is for you to come and say,
我所希望发生的是你过来跟我说

715
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,020
rather than "thank you for teaching me",

716
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,730
something you would say
之类的话

717
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,180
"thank you for reminding me of something that I've already known".
而是"谢谢提醒了我一些我熟知事情"

718
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,640
And this is what this class is about.
这就是本课程要做的

719
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,100
It's constant reminder, twice a week.

724
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,850
whether it's limitation,

that we'll talk about during the change week.

So I'm making common sense more common.
我要让常识更平常

731
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,780
Information in and of itself is simply not enough.
信息本身还不够

732
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:53,400
It's not enough and what we need in addition to our information highway is a transformation highway.

733
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,340

to come through the fast increasing pace.
来经历快速增长的步伐

736
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,810
Because as we'll talk about next time,

对达赖喇嘛你可以有很多评价

1029
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:51,230
One thing you cannot say about him is that he's culturally insensitive,
但你不能说他在文化方面不敏感

1030
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,720
arguably one of the most sensitive people alive.
他可以说是还在世的最敏感的人之一

1031
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,560
And yet he said  we are focusing too much on cultural differences
然而他说 我们对文化差异的关注太多了

1032
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,120
and he added not because there are no cultural differences.
他补充道不是因为没有文化差异

1033
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,370
Of course there are and they are important.
当然有而且很重要

1034
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:08,340
But there are many more similarities than differences.
但文化共同性要比差异多

1035
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,710
And we shouldn't ignore those similarities.
而我们不应该无视这些共同性

1036
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,940
Daniel Goleman about the Dalai Lama,
Daniel Goleman如此评价达赖喇嘛

1037
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,670
"We were a little bit surprised by the Dalai Lama's seeming resistance
"我们有点惊讶于达赖喇嘛这种表面上的

1038
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,580
to the notion of cultural differences.
对文化差异概念的抵触"

1039
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,470
So I am willing to introduce these ideas but A,
所以我想介绍这些观点 但是首先

1040
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,860
because it's not my training and people
因为这不是我的专业

1041
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,770
who are focusing on cultural differences will do a much better job than I do;
研究文化差异的人会比我做得更好

1042
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:32,730
and second, because what I hope to look into is the universal,
其次 因为我所希望研究的是普遍事物

1043
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,180
things are common across cultures.
不同文化中普遍的东西

1044
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,160
So we'll study research in this area.
所以我们会在这方面进行研究

1045
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,110
But even more than that,
但不只是这样

1046
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:51,130
we'll become even more particular than just talking about psychology in this part of the world.
我们的讨论比这部分心理学更具体

1047
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,090
We'll study yourselves.
我们将会研究你们自己

1048
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,770
We are going to go that particular.
我们会如此具体

1049
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:00,960
Now why? When I put this class together,
为什么? 当我开这门课程时

1050
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,950
I didn't think to myself,
我自己没想过

1051
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:05,310
"Ok, so what are the things that I need to introduce

1052
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:11,610
in order to please the participants in the class, the students?"

1053
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,840
That's not what I thought.
那不是我所想的

1054
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:18,710
What I thought about was "what was the class that I would have wanted to take as an undergraduate here?
我所想的是"如果我是个本科生 会想上什么课?

1055
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:22,190
What would help me become happier if I were sitting there?"
如果我坐在这 什么能让我更幸福?"

1056
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,800
In other words, thinking from my perspective from very personal perspective.
换言之 从我的观点 从非常个人的观点出发

1057
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,520
In this class I am going to encourage you.
在我们的课上 我会鼓励你们

1058
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,820
Of course you'll look at research and read research about other people,

1059
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,300
about large sample sizes.
有大量的样本

1060
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,750
But I'm going to encourage you more than anything to look inside yourselves.
但最主要的 我会鼓励你们去看自己的内心

1061
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:38,760
To study yourselves.
去研究自己

1062
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,100
Whether it's through response papers that will be due weekly starting in 2 weeks;
无论是通过两周后开始的每周一次的课后论文

1063
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:49,740
whether it's in your final project that will be a presentation
还是你们最后的演示作业 你们不用做演示

1064
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,990
that you won't have to give but you'll have to write out--
但要写出来 一个关于你最感兴趣的话题

1065
01:00:52,700 --> 01:01:00,600

whether it's in sections that you'll be talking about how can I apply these ideas to my life.
还是关于如何能把这些观点应用于我的生活

1067
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:11,780
The time-ins are about thinking about how can I take in the ideas and use them.
"练习时间"是关于如何接受和利用一些观点

1068
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,590
It's about studying ourselves.
是关于研究我们自己

1069
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,080
Because as Carl Rogers says,
因为正如Carl Rogers所说

1070
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,890
"What is most personal is most general."
"越是个人的东西越普遍"

1071
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,840
"What is most personal is most general."
"越是个人的东西越普遍"

1072
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,460
And as Maslow adds,
正如Maslow所补充

1073
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,560
"We must remember that knowledge of one's own deep nature

1074
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,930
is also simultaneously knowledge of human nature in general."

we are better able to identify with others.

1078
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:46,230
In fact, this is in many ways the source of empathy, of the healthy empathy.
事实上 从许多方面说这是有益移情的来源

1079
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,540
And there are some studies showing that people who know themselves,
有些研究表明了解自己的人

1080
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,820
who study themselves, who are self-reflective,

01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,560
Behavior that would fall under say, racism.

1084
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,940
And it's counter-intuitive to some extent.
在一定程度上这是反直觉的

1085
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,950
"Wait. Don't you first need to study the other
"等等 你难道不要首先研究别人

1086
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,660
so that you can be more sensitive to others?"
才能对别人更敏感吗?"

1087
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,860
Yes, that too.
是的 那也需要

1088
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,520
But it's not enough.
不过还不够

1089
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,170
It is important to also study ourselves,
研究我们自己也很重要

1090
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,340
because when we see our deep nature,

what we encounter there is part of the universal nature,

regardless of where we are from.

1094
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,020
And this was what Dalai Lama was talking about:
而这就是达赖喇嘛所说的

1095
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,910
not stop cross-cultural.
不是阻止跨文化研究

1096
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,700
Do it. Important.

01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:37,180
But at the same time, not ignore the self.

1100
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:50,110
which we know about that we could learn from external observation.
我们知道我们可以从外部观察中学习到的事

1101
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,230
That one thing is ourselves.
那就是我们自己

1102
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,830
We have, so to speak, inside information;
我们有 可以说是 内在的信息

1103
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,740
we are in the know."
我们是知道的"

1104
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:05,720
Now there are of course biases when we study ourselves
当我们研究自己时当然会有偏颇

1105
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,000
which is why it's not enough to just study the self.
这就是为什么只研究自己是不够的

1106
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,980
It's important to counter it,

1107
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,750
to add to it, academic work, studying others.
把学术工作 研究他人融入进去很重要

1108
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:21,740
That's why we'll do some research or study research as well as do some search--
那就是为什么我们除了探究我们的内心外

1109
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,670
searching inside us.
也会做一些研究或调查研究

1110
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,110
Both are important.
两者并重

1111
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:29,480
We shouldn't, just because there are biases and mistakes that potentially can be made,
我们不应该 只是因为会有潜在的偏颇和错误

1112
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,670
it doesn't mean we need to throw out the baby with the bath water
这并不意味着我们要因噎废食

1113
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,990
and stop studying ourselves.
停止探究自己

1114
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,720
So we'll do that or rather you'll do that probably more than any other class on campus.
所以我们会 更准确地说是你们会这样做 比学校里的其他课程做得要多

1115
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,200
Finally this may be news to you,
最后这个可能对你们来说有些新

1116
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,320
but this is not English 10A or Math 55,
但这不是10A号英语课和55号数学课 就是说

1117
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,550
meaning you'll not have to read as much as you will read for 10A or for a history class,
你不用像10A号课或者历史课那样做大量的阅读

1118
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:00,750
and this class is not as difficult as Math 55 so you rest.
也不像55号数学课一样难 所以你们可以轻松些

1119
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,360
I'm sure there are some people here who took the class.
我相信这有些人上过这门课

1120
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,680
This class at the same time is about rigorous fun.

1121
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,480
Fun...because it's fun to study ourselves.
乐趣...因为研究我们自己很有意思

1122
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,760
Sometimes it hurts and sometimes we see things that we may not like,
有时会让我们受伤 有时我们看到一些我们不愿意看到的东西

1123
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,980
but overall it's fun.

1124
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,110
It's interesting.
很有意思

1125
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:23,000
And at the same time it's rigorous, based on research.
同时又是严格的 以研究为基础

1126
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:31,590
Now many of the ideas that you'll encounter in this class are very simple,
你们将在本课程中遇到的许多观点都很简单

1127
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,460
very accessible.
很容易理解

1128
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,310
Common sense.

1129
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,440
However they are simple, not simplistic.
但它们是简单 不是过分简单化

1130
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,350
And here is the difference.
这两者是有区别的

1131
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,920
Oliver Wendell Holmes--
Oliver Wendell Holmes

1132
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,040
this court is attributed to him,
这个报告厅就是他捐建的

1133
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,900
not 100% sure it's his-- said,
但不能完全确定是他所有的--说过

1134
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,850
"I would not give a fig for the simplicity on this side of complexity,
"我不会认为与复杂性一致的简单性是微不足道的

1135
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,600
but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity."
但我会把一生用来研究与复杂性相对的简单性"

1136
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:03,710
What Holmes means here is that he doesn't care about just simplicity,
Homles这里的意思是他关心的不只是简单性

1137
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:07,390
easy, off-the-cuff, whimsical ideas.
简单的 随意的 难以预料的想法

1138
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:11,890
What he does care about though is the simplicity that comes after.
而他所关心的是之后的简单性

1139
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,900
We have chewed the idea,
我们深思了这个观点

1140
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,180
after we have digested it,
在我们吸收了它之后

1141
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,980
after we have thought about it.

Ideas that have been worked on.
那些我们所研究的观点

1143
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:27,060
And if on the other side of complexity we can read simplicity and common sense,
而如果与复杂性相反 我们能看出简单性和常识

1144
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:27,940
that's great.
那就很好

1145
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,070
That's what he's interested in.
那是他所感兴趣的

1146
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:32,210
That is also positive psychology researchers
那也是我们整个学期要讨论的

1147
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:35,860
that we'll discuss throughout the semester are interested in.
积极心理学研究者所感兴趣的

1148

The simplicity on the other side of complexity.
与复杂性相对的简单性

1149
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:43,520
And there is a very big difference between these two simplicities,
这两种简单性之间有很大的区别

1150
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,840
even though on the face of it,
尽管乍看起来

1151
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,030
they may at times look similar.
他们有时也许是相似的

1152
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:56,220
What this class requires is a very different kind of effort.
本课程需要的是一种非常不同的努力

1153
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,890
A very different kind of effort to other class.
与别的课程非常不同的努力

1154
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:05,150
Again it doesn't require the effort that you'll need in 55 or in English 10A.
它不需要你像55号课和10A号英语课那样的努力

1155
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:09,980
The kind of effort that it does require is the effort of application,
它所需要的努力是一种应用的努力

1156
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,320
of applying into your life,

1158
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:22,250
And before we go into some of the technicalities of the class such as the syllabus,
在我们开始讲本课程的一些细节像教学大纲之前

1159
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:27,190
I want to end with a story about Peter Drucker.
我想先讲一个关于Peter Drucker的故事

01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,800
Toward the end of his life while he was still 100% lucid,
在他生命的最后当他头脑还百分百清醒时

1165
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:49,550
it was more difficult for him to be mobile and to go into organizations.
活动和参加组织活动对他来说更加困难了

1166
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:53,200

01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,950
Vertically means that every class connected to the next class

It's also horizontally interconnected.
