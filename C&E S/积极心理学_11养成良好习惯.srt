"are they ever going to take me seriously again?" I hope so.
"他们以后还会不会认真听我的话了" 我希望如此

00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,860
So just a couple of announcements.

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,290
First,there are many emails regarding the response papers,

as the response paper.So the answer is yes and no.

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,110
Alright,next.Yes! You do need to submit it.

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,990
However,if the letter is too personal

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,590
though it would be great if you do.

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,890
The midterm is coming up in a week and a half.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,270
What we have decided to do
我们打算期中考

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,700
is to just have a multiple choice midterm.
只出选择题

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,770
There'll be - can't remember how many - 50? Five zero.
会有... 不太记得了 多少道 50? 50

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,890
50 questions on the multiple choice.
50道选择题

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,220
And you'll have 75 minutes to do it.
有75分钟的作答时间

29
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,250
So we'll allow for the 10 minutes

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,620
or 15 minutes to get organized here.
到十五分钟的时间来组织秩序

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,990
It's not going to be a difficult,you know...
考试不会太难

32
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,430
Try to fool you or to catch you.
要愚弄或是考倒你们

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,530
It's going to be pretty straight forward.
而是会考得很直接

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,280
I've told you my philosophy about exams during the first class,
第一节课我曾告诉过你们我对考试的态度

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,380
those of you who remember.
如果你们还记得的话

36
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,930
In the past,I didn't used to have an exam
过去 我不太习惯弄考试

37
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,430
because I remember I wasn't happy taking exams as an undergrad.
因为我记得我本科时就很讨厌考试

38
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,560
And you know do not do unto others.
己所不欲勿施于人嘛

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,730
But then,I realize that there was the value to them.
不过后来我意识到考试确实是有价值的

40
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,770
Not a value in terms of differentiation,
不是在于高低分化

41
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,170
grades and stuff,all that.
或者成绩之类的

42
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,460
The value is that the midterm or final gets you to sit down
而在于期中考或期末考可以让你安下心来

43
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,240
and synthesize all the material.
整合所有学过的知识

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,030
So if it's a take home,you look for the answers where you are.
如果是家庭作业 你可以找你所需的答案

45
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,420
You take...you just get part of it.
你只掌握了部分的知识

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,910
With the midterm or final,
但有期中考或期末考

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,250
you sit down and you read everything from lesson 1 to lesson 26.
你就能坐下来从第一课看到最后一课

48
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,750
And then that helps you synthesize
而这可以帮助你整合知识

49
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,750
and hence internalize the material.
进而吸收掌握知识

50
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,660
Because remember what I mentioned time and again:
请记住我反复强调的

51
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,190
this class is built around the spiral theory of knowledge,
这门课是基于螺旋形的知识体系的

52
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,320
meaning everything we talked about in lesson 1,in class 1,
也就是说我们在第一课中讲的内容

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,010
is related to class 3,is related to class 7,
与第三课相联系 与第七课相联系

54
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,620
is related to class 24.Everything is interconnected.
与第二十四课有联系 所有东西都是内在相连的

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,580
And it's when you sit down,
而只有你静下心来

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,650
you know when I talk about the material,I know
当我在讲某个知识时 我知道

57
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,150
it's going to come three weeks from now and I know the connection
接下来的三周我会讲到什么 以及它们的联系

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,400
You still don't,but when you sit down and study for the exam,
你们还不能 但当你们坐下来准备考试时

59
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,170
that's when you get to make the connection,
才能建立知识间的联系

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,250
and that's when you really internalize the material
才能从更高的层面真正

61
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,190
at a much higher level.So this is why we have it.
吸收掌握知识 所以我们才要举行考试

62
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,080
I know it's not fun however I think it is pedagogically.
我知道这不好玩 但对教学有好处

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,670
It is important to sit down and have a run through,
静下心来把知识过一遍是很重要的

64
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,440
whether it's the midterm and again,for the final.
不管是期中考还是期末考

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Again,won't be difficult,but do study for it.
再说一次 不会很难 但一定要复习

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,740
It would be very straightforward,fact-based.
考试会很直接 基于事实

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,200
The midterm,as you can imagine,is not about showing creativity.
可以想象得到 期中考不是要展示创造力

68
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,070
Our goal is that you go over the material and synthesize it.
我们的目标是让你们回顾并掌握知识

69
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
If you have any questions,

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,390
please email your TFs and they'll be able to answer.

73
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,630
I think I repress the whole lesson.
我好像忘了上节课的内容

74
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,690
But I was told that I skipped a few things
不过有人跟我说我跳过了一些东西

75
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,900
so that I could get to the show at the end.

who then reflect back to us and at the same time,

we are also communicating to ourselves.

as we talk about "fake it till we make it".

after 144 minutes of intervention.

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,000
Radical difference.But there was a problem.
天翻地覆的变化 但有一个问题

148
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,930
What's the problem with many of these psychological experiment?
许多心理学实验的普遍问题是什么

149
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,390
That you have to debrief.
就是必须向受试者报告结果

150
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,820
Exactly.You have to debrief.

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,300
So six months later,the study was over.

and tell them this was just a study.

It made no difference to these men.

Because by this time,they were much more outgoing.

144 minutes changed their lives,

as far as the dating was concerned at least,if not more.

164
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,730
Why? Think back to Bandura's work on self-efficacy.
为什么呢 回忆一下Bandura对自我效能的研究

165
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,410
Nothing breeds success like success.
没有比成功本身对成功更好的催化剂

166
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,530
When they succeeded,they did well,

167
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,970
they saw themselves doing well- self-perception theory.

168
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Certain conclusions about who they are,

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,140

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,770
and continued that upward spiral.

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,870
Yeah,we talked about 'fake it till we make it',
我们刚刚讲了"不断伪造方能成真"

172
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,830
then watch Marva Collins.
再看看Marva Collins

173
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,260
Chapters of the Fathers.Pirkei Avot.
先祖伦理

174
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,190
One of the seminal Jewish texts:
很重要的犹太教教义写道

175
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,790
"Those whose deeds exceed their wisdom,their wisdom shall endure
"那些行为超越其智慧的人 他们的智慧将恒久"

176
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,050
but those whose wisdom exceeds their deeds,

177
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,500
their wisdom shall not endure.”
"他们的智慧无法持久"

178
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,060
If we just- remember what I talked about-
如果能记住我说过的

179
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,670
if we just go to a workshop or a class,

and understand it on the cognitive level,

even have an ah ha moment,a break through,nothing will happen,

182
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,080
unless we follow our new found wisdom
除非我们的行为跟上了

183
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,580
or understanding with deeds,with action.Why?
这新闪现的智慧 为什么呢

184
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,000
Because we first make our habits,and then our habits make us.
因为我们首先塑造习惯 然后习惯再反过来塑造我们

185
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,550
And if we are before the workshop or class here,
假设我们在参加学术讨论或上课之前是这个水平

186
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,870
and then our attitude changes but our behavior doesn't,

187
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,050
our attitude will be pulled down over time by our habits.
态度会随着时间流逝被习惯又拉回来

188
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,850
So it's only,if we also change our habits over time,
所以只有我们随着时间改变习惯

189
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,600
if we start doing things,if we,for example,

put ourselves on the line- cope.

arguably being most powerful intervention,

197
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
right after the change is going to be ephemeral
否则这改变就会是短暂的

198
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,730
we are going to go back to where we were before.

201
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,130

you know,jumping into the water,just doing it,

218
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,000
or even the better effect,and leads to an upward spiral.

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,900
OK.Then we talked about coping and exiting your comfort zone.
然后我们谈到了应对以及退出舒适区

220
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,350
Parents,please close your eyes at this point.Alright.

And I ended by talking about attaining your

It's great.It's wonderful.However,

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,680
when we are in the comfort zone,very little change happens.

229
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,110
If you go beyond that,we get to our stretch zone.
当跳出舒适区 就到了拉伸区

230
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,030
This is what we call the optimal discomfort zone.

231
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,870
This is where change actually happens.

This is where we have anxiety and difficulty.

Unhealthy for change.

Because very often,we can go back on where we were before.
因为这时通常我们都会回到原来的状态

237
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,430
You can think about this with a metaphor:

238
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,620
the comfort zone would be freezing water.
舒适区就像是结冰的水

239
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,170
The stretch zone would be flowing water.
拉伸区就是流动的水

240
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,680
The panic zone would be boiling water.

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,050
but out of control and potentially dangerous.

You'll read about it next week when you read about flow.

When the task that you are doing,or whatever you are doing,

248
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,260
is not too difficult nor too easy.

See what I did at the end of last class was certainly,

252

but probably not in the panic zone.

253
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,310
Why? Because I already know you-

254
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,240
we have been together for over a month.

255
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,490

256
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,410
So I wasn't taking that much of the risk.

It was just stretching.And it was important for me to do...

I mean,really personally important for me to do it.

259
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,140

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,340
and get me more in touch with my humanity.

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,640
Sometimes though,sometimes though,
但是有时候 有的时候

288
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,680
we have to go to the panic zone.
我们必须要进入恐慌区

289
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,340
why? Because something cannot be changed,

290
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,640
or almost impossible to change gradually.

291
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,800
For example,addiction.

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,050
If I'm addicted to drugs,it's very difficult to say,

294
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,930
inject a little bit less today.A little bit less tomorrow."
今天少一点 明天再少一点"

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,280
It usually has to be abrupt.And then we are in the boiling realm.
通常都要很突然 然后我们就处于沸腾的区域

296
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,790
Then we are in the panic zone.

297
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,920
Quite literally at times,which is why we need help.

In this area,we need someone to hold us.

300
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,800

But generally,if you want to change,
但一般来说 如果你想改变

303
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,210
the healthy approach to change would be along the stretch zone.

304
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,960
It's impossible to change in theory.
仅从理论上来说 是不可能改变的

305
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,590
Now I have said it so many times and yet very often people

And other people say,

It was a fun experience at times- the pink shirt and others.
"这是个很有趣的经历 粉红T恤之类的"

312
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,730

"但对我的生活没有造成实质而持久的影响"

313
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,060
In every...almost all- not in all cases,but in almost all cases,
在每种...几乎所有 并不是所有 但大多数情况下

314
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,500
it's because it wasn't behavioral change associated

to increase confidence- we do it by taking risks,

not by talking and thinking about,

It's a very important value for me.
这对我来说非常重要

574
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,440
And therefore,my wife and I have rituals.

And we have two ritual dates a week.
每周例行的两次约会

576
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,030
Now when people hear it,they say,

"Come on! where is the spontaneity of love?"

578
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,510
Well,there is a lot of spontaneity in terms of

But the dates are set in stone.
但约会的时间次数是定好的

581
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,560
And if I'm travelling or my wife is travelling,

we miss the date,we make up for it after.
错过了约会 那我们就之后再补上

583
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,530
Why? Because if we didn't have this ritual,

584
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:22,320
then we have two dates a decade,as opposed to a week.

And a deeply held value for both of us is our relationship.

there are so many conflicting demands in our time.

Rituals are not just important- they are absolutely necessary.

because family is an important value to us.

603

because of travel or other reasons,rituals are broken.

Because when we are constantly connected to technology,

we are often disconnected from the important things in our lives.

Rituals.Introduce rituals.
例行公事 建立例行公事

614

when they hear about rituals is they say

And if not productivity,creativity." Not so.

In fact,the exact opposite is the case.
事实恰好相反

619
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,960
If you look,- yeah,this is a historical research-
如果看看... 这是个历史性的研究

620
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:18,100
if you look at all the great artists,whether it's writers,
如果看看那些伟大的艺术家 不管是作家

621
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,050
the Hemingways,whether it's the Davincis-

they had a ritual in their life.

They had rituals.And
他们有例行公事

627
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,470
it's because of these rituals that they were able to be creative.

628
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,640
Because then they could think about their subject materials

629
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,160
as opposed to million other things:
而不是万千使他们分心的事物

630
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,750
"Well,maybe I should be doing something else

633
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,110
Almost mindless getting there- just like we brush our teeth.
几乎无意识地就去做了 就像我们刷牙一样

634
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,200
But when they were there,there were space,

635
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,000
openness to be creative.

636
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,630
Now the key is to give yourself time to create the ritual.

Creating a ritual requires a lot of self-discipline.

640
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,160
Once again,because we go back to our old habits.
因为我们时常会回到旧习惯

641
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,540
Let's do a quick exercise.

So I want you to just take your hands and just fold them.

Now how does that feel? Not comfortable right?

So the key is,

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,160
here we are talking about a very simple change- folding hands.

And of course it depends on what habit.
当然要看要改变的习惯是什么

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,430
So give ourselves 30 days to start the gratitude.

Why? Because as we mentioned earlier,

it takes a lot of self-discipline to create a ritual

675
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,430
and we don't have much self-discipline,

676
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,610
which is why when we have a list of 10 changes that

we want to introduce in our lives today,we end up doing none.

00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,950
Because we are over-extending our self-discipline

680
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,440

It takes a lot of discipline to start a ritual,
开始一件例行公事需要大量自律

682
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,670
but once we start it,after a month when it's habituated,
但一旦开始 当一个月后它已成为习惯

683
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,390
when it's grooved in,when the neural pathway has begun to form,

then we can move onto the next ritual and introduce it,

Weekends- we were travelling mostly or had matches at home.

Catch up on all the readings and writings and stuff.

March 1 came.I stopped playing completely.

The athletes know what I am talking about.

730
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,680
Why? Why did I become more,or rather less productive?

731
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,450
Procrastination- wow! Skyrocketed.

Look at me! I trained so hard.I worked,you know,

when I played on the circus six hours a day.

739
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,850
And suddenly,the squash season ended.

741
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,150
And I wasn't getting any work done.

742
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,200
Why? Because I gave up my rituals.
为什么 因为我的例行公事被打破了

743
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,460
You see,during the season,those of you

00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,220
who played varsity or very involved in music or club know that-

when you are investing a lot in a certain organization,

your time has to be ritualized.

747
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,520
So you know you are in practice then or you are ?

748
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,590
in these hours,or you are having meetings at these hours.

And after that you have to go back and work.

750
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,950
Because you only have two hours to do.

00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,670
And you want to get an OK night sleep.

You have rituals.And you are productive and you are creative.

753
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,640
And suddenly the rituals go away.

You said,"OK now I'm gonna work more".

755
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,490
The exact opposite happens.Because we have a limited amount...

756
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,430
It was only when I came to terms of fact

that I have a limits amount of self-discipline.

758
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,680
It's only when I came to terms with the human nature-

759
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,170
nature should be commanded must be obeyed.

760
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,680
It was only then that I actually became productive.
那时我才真正开始变得高效率

761
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,190
Because I created new rituals in my life after that.

Rituals- very important and significant.

The only way for lasting change.

764
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,380
Let me talk about cognition now.The C.
现在来谈谈认知吧 首字母C的这个词

765
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,120
So we talked about affect- the emotions; we talked about behavior
我们已经谈过情感 也谈过行为

766
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:54,930
how important that is both acute and gradual.
谈过它有多重要 既是剧烈的也是逐渐的

767
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,920
Let's talk about cognition.
接下来让我们来谈谈认知

768
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,760
We'll talk again about cognitive reconstruction
再次谈谈认知重建

769
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,090
which is the gradual way of bringing about change.
也是造成改变的渐进方式

770
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,630
And then we'll talk about the fast way of bringing about change,
然后我们再谈谈造成改变的快捷方式

771
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,740
which is the Eureka experience,the ah ha moment.
也就是"有了!"的体验 灵光乍现的一刻

772
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,360
So first,cognitive reconstruction.
首先 认知重建

773
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,860
As we mentioned before,an interpretation is a neural pathway.
正如之前说过的 诠释是一种神经通路

774
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,560
If I interpret the world as a fault finder,
如果我像个消极者一样诠释世界

775
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,390
the fortified neural pathway in my brain are the negative ones,
我大脑里的神经通路就会是消极的

776
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,540
these in experience
生活中的体验

777
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,320
and I go immediately to the negative interpretation
我就会消极地进行诠释

778
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,690
and that gets reinforced over time.
然后随时间不断加强

779
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,450
If I'm a merit finder,I would look the exact same experiences
如果我是个积极者 对相同的经历

780
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,590
and interpret them very differently.
就会有非常不同的诠释

781
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,420
Because I have very different neural pathways in the brain.
因为我大脑中的神经通路就非常不同

782
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:57,990
Of course,
当然了

783
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,200
there are consequences to how we interpret our experiences.
我们如何诠释经历是有不同结果的

784
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,220
Not necessarily that things happen for the best,
不一定会有最好的结果

785
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,690
but as a merit,as a benefit finder- sorry,I change that.
但作为积极者 抱歉我换了个说法

786
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,730
As a benefit finder,looking more at the,
作为积极者 更能看到

787
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,310
at the positive with each experience.
每段人生经历中积极的方面

788
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,190
Now remember the study on the identical twins
回忆一下同卵双胞胎的研究

789
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,340
and how much genes actually matter.
以及其中基因到底有多大影响

790
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,010
That only account for 55% of the variance.
那只能解释55%的差异

791
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,220
So here is the story that's told in many intro to psych textbooks
这是很多心理学入门教材中会提到的故事

792
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,530

a moment of soberness and says to the twin,

806

were deemed cooperative or competitive,predicted nothing.

If they were in the "Wall Street game",

1010
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,530

1013
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,720
In other words,how we frame a situation-

A very important question which is

And the wonderful answer that she came up with is

let's get students as well as people in society at large to

reframe how we look at volunteering,

rather than as duty,something I have to do.

It is a real privilege to give,to help.

1029
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,190

This has implications for child rearing.

I am going to dedicate much time when we discuss relationships.

But just very briefly,this understanding for me transformed,

if we want long-term,successful,thriving,

"OK so how can my partner get to know me even better?"

Doing it gradually of course.

sustain the relationship as well as their passion,over time.

And again,I am going to talk about much more...

I am going to devote two classes at least to relationships.

You know when I initially started to teach,

I really wanted the validation from the students.

So how can I have my students perceive me as a good teacher?

We all like to be liked.

00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,710

I still want to be liked-

这确实改变了我很多 不再是得到认可 也就是说

to appear perfect,but it was to be known as a human being,

of course- permission to be human.

and I enjoyed it so much more.

Because there is so much less pressure on us in a relationship,

01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,240
that it also makes the relationship so much healthier.

But again,much more on it- because it is so important.

So important topic.We talked about this a lot.

How do we perceive failure,as a stumbling block?

1090
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:41,880
A catastrophe? Or as an opportunity? As a growth experience?

1091
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,370

We'll talk about it after spring break

when we discuss perfectionism and the fear of failure.

01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,940
the study that you read by Ali Crum and Ellen Langer.
你们读到的Ali Crum和Ellen Langer做的研究

1096
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,330
So just give you a little bit background about the study
先给你们讲点这个研究的背景

1097
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,840
and I will briefly mention it,hopefully you've read it already.
我会简要地提一提 希望你们都已经读过了

1098
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:07,440
Ali Crum was my student for,since her freshman year.
Ali Crum从大一起就是我的学生

1099
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,880
I was her TF when I taught with Phil Stone.
我是她的助教 那时我和Phil Stone一起教学

1100
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:15,100
And then I was her thesis advisor with Ellen Langer.
然后我和Ellen Langer是她的毕业论文导师

1101
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,070
And this was the topic of her thesis.
这是她的毕业论文题目

1102
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,840
When Ellen Langer came up with the idea for the thesis,
当Ellen Langer提出这个想法时

1103
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,680
and she told Ali and me
她告诉我和Ali

1104
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,990
"this is what I think would be a very interesting study",
"我觉得这会是个有趣的研究"

1105
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,600
I took Ellen aside after the study- after the meeting,
我在会后把Ellen叫到一边

1106
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,480
after Ali went away.
在Ali走了之后

1107
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,620
And I told her "Ellen I don't think it's fair.
我跟她说"Ellen我觉得这样不公平"

1108
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,890
I don't it's fair that Ali will do her thesis on it."
"我觉得让Ali用这个做毕业论文不太公平"

1109
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,330
Because the thesis is a very tough experiment-
因为这是个非常困难的实验

1110
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,570
you'll hear about it if you haven't read about it in a minute.
如果你们没看过的话 一会儿就会听到了

1111
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,260
"If we take a lot of time from her,

1112
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,270
she's not going to get any results."
"她也不会有任何成果"

1113
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,400
Now you can write your senior thesis with getting no result,
现在你们的毕业论文可以没有结果

1114
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,180
without getting a result,that's OK.
没有成果也没关系

1115
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,500
But I said,"why waste her time,her senior year?"
但我说"干嘛浪费她的时间呢"

1116
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:03,040
And she said to me,"will work." I said to her,"no it won't."
她跟我说"会有结果的" 我说"不会的"

1117
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,530
And boy,did it work!
而最后真的有结果

1118
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,370
Now I've learned since not to argue with Ellen Langer
我从那时起就学会了不和Ellen Langer争辩

1119
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,070
because she has ideas that you would never think would work,
因为她总有你觉得不可能有结果的想法

1120
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:15,630
but they do like the study we mentioned with the 1979
但他们确实很喜欢我们1979年的

1121
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,520
"I'm going back to 1959" or with the eye test,
"回到1959"实验 或是那个视力测试

1122
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:24,510
being simply in the flying simulator improves your eyesight.
只是飞行模拟器提升了你的视力

1123
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:30,300
Again,ideas that seem fantastic,but she proves them right.
就是这些看起来很无厘头的想法 她证明它们是正确的

1124
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,110
So the same happened here with this study.
这个研究也是如此

1125
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,150
The study was Ali went to hotels

and worked with the ladies who were cleaning the hotels.

And she went to them to two groups

1128
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,710
and told both groups the importance of physical exercise.

1129
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:46,240
And she said,
她说

1130
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,200
"this is,you know,something brought to you by your hotel,
"这是你们酒店搞的

1131
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,870
just to show you how important exercise is."
只是为了让你们知道锻炼有多重要"

1132
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,780
And then she tested them on all these physical measures,

1133
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,970
whether it was body fat,blood sample-

01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:05,600
how much fat they had in their blood,weight,

1135
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,740
psychological measures- depression,anxiety,and so on and so on.

1136
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,160
And what she did was...
而她所做的是

1137
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,920
to the one group,she just left them after all these tests.
对于其中一组 她测试完后就不管她们了
