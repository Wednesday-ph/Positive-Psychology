Now what I'd like you to do - and this is completely voluntary

hear some of you just talk about you know one thing
听听你们讲讲一样

180

but what was meaningful or interesting for you this semester

And we have some microphones spread around the room

185
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,900
So if anyone would like to be the first one, to volunteer

186
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,100
remember courage is not about not having fear

I think for me what the most important thing was was the idea

not being frivolous or selfish

one should actively pursue and can help the people around you

196
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,800
more than by pursuing that what you are told to pursue

197
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Great. So essentially dissolving this divide between self and the other

198
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
And remember

the Dalai Lama - how surprised he was when he came to the west

means essentially compassion toward others
指的是对其他人的同情

202
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,900
whereas Sawai in Tibetan means compassion toward others
而藏语中Sawai既指对他人的同情

203
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,600
and compassion toward oneself
也包括对自我的同情

204
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
They go hand in hand; they are intertwined

205
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,200

is very much about helping ourselves

I found the Roger Bannister story really meaningful to me

you can't do it
你做不到

215
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,900
And we have that voice at the back of our mind
我们的脑海中总是回响着这样的声音

216
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,700
those limiting beliefs
这些狭隘的想法

217
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,400
whether it's limiting beliefs about how we can feel

can feel; and what we can achieve

The day when you told the story about your grandmother

was very, very moving for me

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,700
be so emotionally moved in this academic setting
实在是一种特殊而难得的体验

229

I really like the idea that we can get over things

bad things a lot quicker than we would anticipate

I just think that you know so often

237
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000

but I think, you know

240

just the idea of going forward and

241
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,200
that we will ultimately get over it if it doesn't work out
就算没能达到也会最终释怀的想法

242

That's really important
是非常重要的

243
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,300
Right, yes. So you know
没错

244
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,400
just like when we achieve something good

245
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,500
we go back to base level and feel like as we did before

Yes
请说

252
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
For me, it was important to realize balance between the rat racer
在我看来 找到竞争主义者和享乐主义者之间的

253
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,300
and the hedonist
平衡点很重要

254
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,800
finding the balance between short term benefit and long term benefit
以及短期益处和长期益处之间的平衡

255
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,400
Right. You know
是的

256
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,800
so much of our lives is about ＂either or＂
人生经常会遇到"非此则彼"的情况

257
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,400
Either I'm a successful rat racer

258
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,700
or I'm a hedonist who has given up essentially on success
要么就是个放弃成功的享乐主义者

259
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,400
Whereas what we can very  often do is reconcile the two

260
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,500
You know, eat the cake and leave it whole - so it seems

Future benefit and present benefit in one

To seek to be known and not validated - and the way you taught the class

264
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
opening up, let's say

Thank you. You know when

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,600
what I shared at I think the very first class here was what Carl Rogers said

272
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,100
which is ＂what is most personal is most general＂
"最个人的也是最大众的"

273
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,500
Because deep down humanity is humanity, is humanity
因为从本质来说 这些都是人性

274
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,900
And when we live in the world with the desire to be known

275
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
expressing ourselves

276
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
that's I think when we can reach out most to others
这是我们最能和他人触碰的时候

277
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,800
whether it's in a romantic relationship

Thank you
谢谢

281
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes
请说

282
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,100
One thing I would take away from this class is

to be conscious about being grateful
要学会感恩

284
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,300

you take for granted the people you love the most

to also take on this change in their life

So taking this class really helped me

aware the circumstances really don't control your happiness level

315
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,700
that I have more than an active role like how I feel
我应该更积极地了解自己的感受

316
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,100

remember one of the things we talked about is that

318
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,200
at least I don't believe that things necessarily happen for the best

The class allowed me so many times during almost every day

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
or something that I wasn't doing well enough

where we think well everyone is doing great except for me

So I'm going to pretend that I'm doing great too

340
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,900
And then we become part of that great deception

341
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,000
reinforcing it
一定要反复强调

I have never seen myself as a perfectionist

and I think it's just kind of self denial

different readings that we've done have really allowed me to

explore that, and accept that

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:36,800
and make proactive changes in my life to grow away from that

352
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,300
Great. You know perfectionism is again another thing that so many people hide
很好 完美主义同样是人们经常隐藏的

353
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,900
because perfectionist almost by definition doesn't want to show the weakness
因为完美主义者从定义上说就不愿意显露出弱点

354
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
And as I mentioned in the class
正如我在课上所说的

355
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,000
unperfectionism for me has been the most important

360
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,500

as improvement, growth and permission
也就是进步 成长 和允许为人

362
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
So for me one of the things that really resonated
我觉得最有共鸣的一点就是

363
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,400
was the idea of reframing the question
就是重新构建问题

364
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
At the very beginning
在学期刚开始时

365

start looking at what is working in terms of research

And, so I will take that with me into my academics

where they missed the answer to how can we improve their lives

379
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,400
They missed it because they did not also ask the positive question

380
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,800
And it applies into every area of our lives as I'll talk about soon

you are just reminding us what we already know

Yes
请说

425
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,300
For me it's the concept of integrity
我觉得是正直的概念

426
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,400
because I think we are all honest people

00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
when we compromise our beliefs

or act in a way that doesn't align with how we think we should

and that that really takes toll on our self esteem

And so the idea of being constantly aware of and maintaining our integrity

432
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,100
I think really stands to helps us feel better about ourselves

we are communicating a certain message to ourselves
其实正给自己传递了某种信息

don't need to put on a facade or impress
无需过分想给他人留下印象

441
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,100
Then the message
而这个信息

442
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,300
the self perception theory actually enhances
这个自我知觉理论能提升

443
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,800
how we feel about ourselves
我们对自身的看法

444
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,200
not to mention that it helps interpersonal communication
更不用说对人际关系的提升了

445
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
And the world would be a better place
也能使世界变得更美好

446
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000

448
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,500
Yes
请说

One the the phrases that you shared with us

in your lectures that's really impacted me

the anxiety and fear of making a mistake

admittedly because I value honesty I will say I took it

to an otherwise a difficult senior spring

I've been using these lessons that I learned sophomore year

when your friends need your attention for an hour

the questions that you ask

will very often determine the quest that you take

00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,600
And if we only ask the negative questions such as

＂why do so many of these individuals fail?＂

765

that exists in each individual if we only ask

＂How can my relationship be improved?＂

768
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,400
Then we will not see all the wonders and the treasures

769
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,800
and the miracle that exist in the person next to us
