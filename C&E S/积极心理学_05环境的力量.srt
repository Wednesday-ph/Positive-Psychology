165
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,540
between this class and our master program.

who come from a wide variety of professions.
来自各行各业

180
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,190
In our first class,
在第一班里

181
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,120
we had the former chief social worker inspector
学生中有来自苏格兰的

182

for the entire country of Scotland within the class.
全国前社工总监

183
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,060
That was very interesting.
那很有趣

184
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,570
We had kidney transplant surgeon,

even professional musician and professional comedian.
甚至音乐家和喜剧演员

192
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,560
So it is quite a cross cut of students in the class.
班里的学生可谓五花八门

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,300
Just in a couple of minutes,
我想用两分钟

194
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,350
I want to give you a little bit more sense of what educational design
简单介绍一下教学设计

195
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,820
is and just a brief over view of the course work.
再简介一下课程内容

196
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,620
So this MAPP program is a one calendar year, full-time study.
本课程是一年制全日制学习

197
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,380
Students begin in September and end in August.
九月开始 八月毕业

198
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,040
The educational design is hybrid model--
我们的教育设计是混合模式

199
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,300
so once a month, students are on class,
每个月 学生

200
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,680
on site, for intensive on site classes.
有一次现场教学

201
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,510
And then in the intervening periods,
其余时间

202
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,510
they are on distant learning modules that the students complete.
学生通过远程学习模式完成

203
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,810
This is a professional master degree.
这是一个职业硕士学位

204
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,960
And it focuses on
教学重点放在

205
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,910
the theory and the application of positive psychology
积极心理学理论

206
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,080
in various professional domains.
及在各行各业的应用

207
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,150
So at this point,
目前来说

208
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,660
there is not a separate licensing or credentialing
积极心理学

209
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,800
in positive psychology itself.
还没有独立的执照或证书

210
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,690
Students come from education,
学生来自教育

211
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,580
business, law, medicine, etc,
商业 法律 医疗等各个领域

212
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,030
bringing in their own credentials with them.
都有自己的文凭

213
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,030
So this design of having students on campus
让学生每月来校一次

214
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,080
once a month for intensive classes
进行现场教学的设计

215
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,630
allows students to continue working full time.
允许学生继续全职工作

216
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,480
Now just as I said,
我刚说过

217
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,370
the program is full time and you may be wondering,
课程是全日制的 你可能奇怪

218
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,120
"How can students work full time and study full time."
"怎么可能一边工作一边全日上课"

219
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Keep in mind this is a professional degree
请记住这是一个职业学位

220
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,090
and executive education model
高级管理人员教育模式

221
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,970
that is intended to be designed for people
就是为那些

222
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,930
who are themselves working full time
全职工作的人员设计的

223
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,790
and still taking classes full time.
同时上全制日课程

224
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,440
So most of our students continue their work
多数学生继续

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,400
they've been doing,
他们从事的工作

226
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,360
continuing working full time when they come to our class.
继续全职工作同时又能上课

227
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,210
Another advantage of this model
这种模式的另一个优势

228
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,710
is students aren't required to live in Philadelphia.
是不需要学生居住在宾州附近

229
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,330
Students can commute in from across United States.
学生从全国各地赶来

230
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,560
And what has been a surprise and pleasure to us:
即让我们惊讶且欣喜的是

231
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,680
students have decided to commute
远在欧洲和亚洲的学生

232
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,940
in from as far away as Europe and Asia.
也决定赶来

233
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,360
I don't know today what you commute was like to come to class.
我不知道现在你们如何来上课

234
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,660
But some of our students come

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,860
as far away as South Korea and New Zealand every month
每月从南韩和新西兰赶来

236
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,270
to be part of the positive psychology classes.
参加积极心理学课程

237
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,570
So you can imagine that
可以想象

238
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,220
adds real excitement and energy to the class
为课堂带去的兴奋和活力

239
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,980
and puts a little bit pressure on the professors to make sure that
也给教授施加了压力 我们要确保

240
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,750
we have something worth coming half way around the world for.
能传授值得绕半个地球赶来学习的知识

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,830
This enhances the educational experience obviously
学生的多样性

242
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,240
by increasing student diversity:
提升了教学体验

243
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,300
we have students who are living abroad
居住在海外的学生

244
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,880
and coming in for the classes.
赶来上课

245
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,950
And also we are able to tap into the expertise of professors,
我们还聘请多位教授

246
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,210
not just at the University of Pennsylvania,
不局限于宾州大学

247
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,290
but also at other schools as well
还有其他大学

248
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,020
so that we can bring in the very top leading researchers
我们请来最杰出的研究员

249
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,830
and practitioners of positive psychology.
和积极心理学的从业者

250
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,050
A brief overview of the schedule of on-site classes on the fall 2008:
简单概述2008年秋的现场教学

251
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,260

but now move to the application of positive psychology

that they want to go in their own professional application of this.

whether it's Bob Fredrickson who we'll talk about in a few minutes,
比如Bob Fredrickson 过一会我们会谈到他

456
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,250
whether it's David Cooper we'll talk about,
或者以后会谈到的David Cooper

457
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,230
whether it's Martin Seligman of course,
当然还有Martin Seligman

458
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,310
will come there and present to you
都会去那里给大家讲座

459
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:52,330
and you'll be spending quality time in small groups with them.
你将和他们亲密相处

460
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,530
Real privilege.
真是一种特权

461
00:21:53,810 --> 00:22:06,260
So what I want to do today is finish up on the basic premises,
今天我想结束有关基础前提的讨论

462
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,140
on the final premise.
讨论最后一个前提

463
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,240
Now we are going to watch it again. No?
还要再看这个吗 不

464
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,580
Or that?
这个也不用看了

465
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,440
Here we go.
可以了

466
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,540
The final and the fifth premise is an important one;
最后也是第五个前提很重要

467
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,500
is a philosophical one
是一个哲学前提

468
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,370
but one I want to introduce at the beginning of the course
但我想在课程开始时介绍

469
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,650
so that you understand where I am coming from,
你们好理解我讲课的起源

470
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,670
where this course is coming from--
这门课程的来源

471
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,450
because many people say,
因为很多人说

472
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,350
"Ok, so happiness is important.
好的 快乐是重要的

473
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,790
We seek it; we have declarations--
我们寻找它 我们有宣言

474
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,930
national declarations,
国家宣言

475
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,000
individual declarations of how important it is for us.
关于快乐对我们多么重要的个人宣言

476
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But that doesn't mean that it is important or the "is",
但那不代表它是重要的 问题在于这个"是"

477
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,670
the fact that it is important doesn't mean we ought to do it.
它是重要的但不代表我们应该去做

478
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,920
My argument here is that not only is it important,
我认为它不仅重要

479
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,170
it also ought to be important.
而且也应该是重要

480
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,480
So first about the "is".
首先要阐述这个"是"

481
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,080
Happiness, whether we like it or not,

482
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,440
whether it's consciously ,
不论它是有意识地

483
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,450
subconsciously, whether it's explicit or implicit,
还是潜意识地 不论它是明显的还是隐晦的

484
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,410
for most people--
对多数人来说

485
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,910
not all, but for most people,
不是全部但对多数人来说

486
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,830
it is the highest end.
快乐是最高追求

487
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,330
And again, we have Constitution save God in our pursuit of happiness.
我们有宪法保证我们追求快乐

488
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,410
We spend a lot of effort,

489
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,660
a lot of time thinking about it for ourselves as well as for others.
大量时间思考自己和他人的快乐

490
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,920
Aristotle, over 2000 years ago,

491
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,450
"Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life,

492
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,160
the whole aim and end of human existence."

493
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,500

494
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,690
in 1890 or in "The Variety of Religious Experiences" writes, "
1890年在"宗教经验之种种"中写道

495
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,130
If we were to ask the question:
如果要问

496
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,720
"What is human life's chief concern?"
人类生命最主要的担心是什么?

497
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,330
one of the answers we should receive would be:
我们应该得到的一个答案是

498
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,960
"It is happiness."
"是快乐"

499
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,360
How to gain, how to keep,

500
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,280
how to recover happiness,
如何重获快乐

501
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,330
is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all they do,
是多数人时刻怀有的秘密动机

502
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,160
and all they are willing to endure."
是他们愿意忍受一切的目的

503
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Now you may have heard of William James--
你们可能听说过William James

504
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,970
his name is after the building here.
这里有幢大楼以他命名

505
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,250
And he talked about this over 200 years ago;
他在二百多年前谈到快乐

506
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,230
Aristotle over 2000 years ago.
亚里斯多德在二千多年前也谈过

507
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,800
And it's not just peculiar to the West.
而且不只是西方人

508
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,610
The Dalai Lama, "Whether one believes in a religion or not,
达赖喇嘛 "不论一个人是否相信宗教

509
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,180
whether one believes in this religion or that religion,
不论一个人相信这种还是那种宗教

510
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,900
the very purpose of our life is happiness.
我们生命的最终目标是快乐

511
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,040
The very motion of our life is towards happiness."
我们生命的主要活动是寻找快乐"

512
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,330
So it is important for people.
快乐是重要的

513
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,460
Again, whether it's conscious,
不论是有意识的

514
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,710
subconscious, explicit or implicit,
还是潜意识的 明显的还是隐晦的

515
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,810
the question though is in fact it is important,
问题是它确实重要

516
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,670
should it be important?
但快乐应该是重要的吗？

517
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,480
What about the moral dimension of happiness?
快乐的道德维度呢？

518
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,060
There are so many other things happening,
还有很多事情在发生

519
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,700
so many important things to do in the world.
世上有很多重要的事情要做

520
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,520
Why should we have happiness as our highest end,

521
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
as our chief concern,
作为主要担心

522
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,390
as that which determines the motion of our life?
为什么由它来决定生命活动？

523
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,510
In other words, what's good about wellbeing?
换言之 幸福有什么好处？

524
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,620
What's good about positive emotions?
积极情绪有什么好处？

525
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,970
And there is a lot of research to answer this question.
大量研究都尝试回答这个问题

526
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,240
But before the research,
暂不说研究

527
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,430
it feels good to feel good.
感觉好就是感觉好

528
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,200
Think about it. Internalize it.
想到快乐 注入内心

529
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,390
This is Aristotle's Law of Identity:
这是亚里斯多德的"同一律"

530
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,170
A is A-- it feels good to feel good.
一即一 感觉好就是感觉好

531
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,810
And that, in and of itself is justification:
这本身就是辩解理由

532
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,920
why not feel good, if we can feel good?
如果能感觉好 为什么不感觉好呢?

533
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,220
So the burden to prove
证明

534
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,520
why happiness is not important may be on the people
快乐为什么是不重要的重担可能落在

535
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,120
who would argue otherwise--
执否定观点的人身上

536
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,820
we will talk about that argument later.
我们会在以后谈到这个论点

537
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,350
But the first key issue is that it's good in and of itself--
但首先的关键问题是快乐本身是好的

538
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,570
almost needs no justification.
几乎无需辩解

539
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,150
However, beyond just feeling good,
然而除了感觉好

540
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,290
happiness also contributes to our life,
快乐还对我们的人生有帮助

541
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,770
to our relationships.
对人际关系有帮助

542
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,130
It contributes to other people.
对他人有帮助

543
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,500
This is research done by Barbara Fredrickson,
Barbara Fredrickson做了这项研究

544
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,880
one of the faculty members who teaches at U PENN.
在宾州大学任教的学会成员

545
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,430
You saw a picture of her up there.
你们曾在上面见过她的照片

546
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,010
What Barbara Fredrickson says is that
Barbara Fredrickson的观点是

547
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:34,200
positive emotions have an evolutionary reason,
积极情绪有一个进化理由

548
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,930
that they have a purpose beyond just making us feel good.
它们的目的不仅仅是让人感觉好

549
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,370
For example, they help us think beyond
比如它们有助我们超越

550
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,930
what we are thinking right now, broaden our thinking;
现在的思考范畴 拓展我们的思想

551
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,500
they help us build relationships;
有助我们建立人际关系

552
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,160
they help us build capacities--
帮助我们建立能力

553
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
remember one of the key concepts of this course
这门课的一个主要概念

554
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,180
is the positive emotions,
就是积极情绪

555
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,460
positive psychology as a field as a whole,
积极心理学

556
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,400
is about building capacities.
就是要建立能力

557
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,140
The two analogies we use
我们使用的两个类比

558
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:05,460
was strengthening our immune system or stronger "psychological engine"
是加强我们的免役系统或加强"心理引擎"

559
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,700
that has the capacity to endure more
获得更强大的忍受能力

560
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,590
not just from the negative to zero,
不只是从负到零

561
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,570
but also from the zero to the positive.
还要从零到正

562
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,990
So this is Barbara Fredrickson.
这是Barbara Fredrickson的观点

563
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,660
Let me quote extensively from her article,
我想进一步引用她的文章

564
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,840
which I believe you are reading for this week,
也是你们这周要阅读的

565
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,570
"We should work to cultivate positive emotions
"我们应该努力培育积极情绪

566
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,570
in ourselves and in those around us,
在自己身上和周围人身上

567
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,870
not just as end states in themselves,
不能只将它们作为终极状态

568
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,500
but also as a means to achieving psychological growth
还要将其作为手段实现心理成长

569
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,330
and improved psychological and physical health over time.
改善心理和身体的健康

570
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,620
I call this the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions
我称其为积极情绪的扩建理论

571
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,400
because positive emotions appear to broaden people's momentary thought
因为积极情绪似乎能扩展人们的瞬间想法

572
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,410
action repertoire and build the enduring personal resources.
和动作指令库并建立持久的个人资源

573
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,600
Through experiences of positive emotions,
通过体验积极情绪

574
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,140
people transform themselves,
人们实现改变

575
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,770
becoming more creative, knowledgeable,
变得更有创造力 更博学

576
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,850
resilient, socially integrated,
适应性更强 更易融入社会

577
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,720
and healthy individuals."
获得更健康的人格"

578
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,870
Numerous benefits to just experiencing positive emotions.
体验积极情绪有诸多好处

579
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,580
It's a win-win.
是双赢的

580
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,590
It feels good.
它让人感觉好

581
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,130
And it's good for us and it's good for society as a whole
对我们有好处 对整个社会也有好处

582
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,470
as I'll argue momentarily.
一会我就会解释

583
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,260
So what she's talking about here, for example,
她谈到的问题包括

584
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,840
is that positive emotions help us overcome negative emotions.
积极情绪有助我们克服消极情绪

585
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,540
What happens when we experience negative emotions
体验消极情绪时

586
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,900
is that our consciousness,
我们的意识

587
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,320
our thinking narrows and constricts.
我们的思维变得狭窄 收紧

588
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,160
We focus just on one thing, so for example.
只专注于一件事 比如

589
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,610
And that can be a good thing--
那可能是件好事

590
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,630
you know, a lion comes to and charges me,
一头狮子朝我冲过来

591
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,600
"I don't want to start thinking about my MAPP application.
我不想考虑宾州大学硕士申请的事

592
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,790
I don't want to start thinking about what my roommates say.
不想考虑室友说了什么

593
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,490
I want to focus on the lion.
我只想考虑这头狮子

594
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,470
So my consciousness narrows and constricts,
我的意识变得狭窄 收紧

595
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,280
and I'm in the "fight or flight" mode.
进入"对抗或逃跑"模式

596
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,780
Now that's a good thing when a lion charges me.
有狮子朝我冲来时是件好事

597
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,020
But it's not a very good thing
但它变得不是很好

598
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,480
if my consciousness continues to narrow
如果我的意识继续狭窄

599
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,250
and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship.
收紧超出威胁 超出困难

600
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,310
And what we know is that very often we enter a downward spiral,
我们知道经常会进入下行螺旋

601
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,360
a vicious cycle when we go into this narrow and constrict mode.
一个恶性循环 当我们进入狭窄收紧的模式

602
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,160
So for example, just for example-- a random example:
随便举个例子

603
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,350
My girlfriend leaves me, alright?
女朋友离开了我

604
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,240
And I narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking--
我的思维收窄缩紧

605
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,770
all I am thinking about is just that.
一心只想着被女友甩了

606
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,320
And what will happen is as a result,
结果就是

607
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,090
I experience sadness,
我感觉悲伤

608
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,680
because that is what I am thinking about, and sadness--
因为我一心只想那个 悲伤

609
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,170
a painful emotion, not a positive emotion--
是一种痛苦的情绪 一种消极情绪

610
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,180
leads to further narrow and constrict.
导致进一步的收窄缩紧

611
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,810
And that can potentially,
那有可能

612
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,100
not always, but potentially can go on and on and on.
并非总是 但可能一直持续下去

613
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,350
And that's when it can become depression.
直到变成抑郁

614
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,640
That's when I have difficulty getting out of this downward,
那时我将很难脱离这种下行

615
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,600
vicious cycle.
恶性的循环

616
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,020
Positive emotions do the opposite.
积极情绪正相反

617
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,850
They broaden and build.
它们扩展建立

618
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:07,560
Broaden and build leads to positive emotions.
扩建导致积极情绪

619
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,660
Then positive emotions further broaden and build.
积极情绪再进一步扩建

620
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,290
So that's a virtuous cycle.
所以是个良性循环

621
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,050
And I look broadly,
我眼界宽了

622
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,180
I look to othe people,
关注其他人

623
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
I look to other things: So what can I do now?
关注其他事 思考现在我能做什么?

624
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,980
Where can I go? Where can I spend my time?
我能去哪里?我把时间用在哪里?

625
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,690
And very often what that does--
很经常的是

626
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,360
a positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral
积极情绪把我们带出下行螺旋

627
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,260
and create an upward spiral.
形成一个上行螺旋

628
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,980
A positive emotion can come in form of watching a humorous film;
积极情绪可以是看一部滑稽电影

629
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,360
it can come in form of "if you take a deep breath"--
可以是"一次深呼吸"

630
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,970
we talked about deep breathing when we talked about my body;
探讨"心理 身体"时会谈到深呼吸

631
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,150
a positive emotion can come in form of interaction with a friend,
积极情绪可以是与朋友交流

632
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,500
a pleasant one.
一次愉快的交流

633
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,720
It's the positive emotion
积极情绪

634
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,650
that can take us out from this downward spiral to this upward spiral.
能把我们带离这个下行螺旋进入这个上行螺旋

635
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,230
And again it doesn't always take a very long time.
而且不用很久

636
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,710
And the challenge is to combine "the permission to be human"
困难在于将之与准许为人相结合

637
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,150
to experience the emotion to go through the motion
去体会情绪 实现转移

638
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,880
and yet not to enter the downward spiral where six months later,
但不会进入下行螺旋

639
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,950
after small incident, I'm still in that rot.
在发生小小意外六个月后 仍心情低落

640
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,370
We'll talk about what is the right time
我们会谈到什么是合适的时候

641
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,510
and how do you find the right time,
如何找到合适的时候

642
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,650
how do you find the balance
以及如何在

643
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,070
between thinking about painful emotions
思考痛苦情绪

644
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,540
and when does it slide to rumination,
和让痛苦情绪滑入沉思到平衡

645
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,040
which is not always helpful.
沉思并非总有帮助

646
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,000
So it helps overcome the negative emotions.
它有助克服消极情绪

647
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,060
Also, creativity-- we think broadly--
还有创造力 我们的眼界更宽

648
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,050
we are able to make connections,
能产生更多联系

649
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,620
see connections we haven't seen before, perhaps.
看到以前没有看到的联系

650
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,910
There's a lot of the talk about the depressive creature.
有很多关于"抑郁创造者"的说法

651
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,960
If you want to have high level of creativity,
如果你想拥有更高水平的创造力

652
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,470
it's a must you have to be depressed.
必须承受抑郁

653
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,160
Well, it turns out that's not the case.
其实并非如此

654
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,020
Very often manic depressives are highly creative,
躁狂抑郁病人一般更有创造力

655
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,090
but that's usually during their manic phases.
但一般在躁狂阶段

656
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,940
In the depressed phase, our thinking is narrow;
在抑郁阶段 我们的思维收窄

657
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,530
we don't think outside the box usually--
我们失去创造力

658
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,050
of course there's many exceptions, but as a whole.
当然有例外 但总体而言没有

659
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,160
In fact there's research--
实际上有这样一项研究

660
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,380
for example, this was done with internists, doctors,
在内科医生 医生中间进行

661
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,910
who are giving a very difficult,
向他们提出一个

662
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,430
very difficult question connected to a liver problem
与肝脏问题有关的很困难的问题

663
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,810
that an individual patient had.
那是一个病人的病症

664
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,140
And they divided them randomly into three groups--
医生们被随机分成三组

665
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,580
the first group was a control group--
第一组是对照组

666
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,160
they just had to solve the problem;
他们必须解决这个问题

667
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,330
the second group was given a statement
第二组听一段有关

668
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,190
about humanistic value of medicine--
医学人文观的声明

669
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,100
why is it so important to be a medical doctor;
为什么作医生如此重要

670
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,890
and the third group was given candy
第三组得到糖果

671
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,910
and put in a funny playful good mood.
让他们获得愉快放松的好心情

672
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,790
The third group that was given the candies
第三组得到糖果

673
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,660
and put in a positive playful mood
并获得积极愉快的心情

674
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,790
outperformed the other two groups significantly--
明显比另外两组有更好表现

675
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,320
they thought about more options
他们考虑更多选择

676
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,760
and they actually came up with better solutions with that problem.
得出更好的问题解决办法

677
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,800
And this is one of many studies in this area.
这是这个领域中的一项研究

678
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,210
Another example-- children.
再举个例子 小孩子

679
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,290
One group of children was a control group;
一群小孩组成对照组

680
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,420
the second group was taught to think back
有人教第二组小孩回想

681
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,720
to experience that make them laugh or smile.
让他们大笑或微笑的经历

682
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,290
And that group did much better
第二组

683
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,100
on the learning task than the control group,
在学习任务上比对照组表现更好

684
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,770
because they were put into a positive mood.
因为他们被置于积极情绪

685
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,760
Again, it's a win-win.
它是双赢的

686
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,960
It's defined in many ways that "no pain, no gain" paradigm,
它在很多方面定义了"没有痛苦就没有回报"

687
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,090
whether it's education of doctors or in school,
不论是对医生的教育还是在学校

688
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,440
as well as generally in the workplace.
在一般的工作场所也一样

689
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,780
Because you see, also motivation and energy--
因为动力和精力

690
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,080
you don't need research for that,
不需要研究就能明白

691
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,650
you know that when you are feeling good,
你知道感觉好时

692
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,180
you have more motivation, you have more energy--
动力和精力更充沛

693
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,020
of course, there is a lot of research to back that up.
当然有很多研究支持这一点

694
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,990
And ultimately success.
最终达到成功

695
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,860
They look in the professional people
他们调查专业人士

696
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,240
who are able to manage their emotions
能更好地控制自己的情绪

are in the long term more successful.
长远会取得更大成功

700
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,340
Again, it's not that people who don't have painful emotions--
他们不是没有痛苦情绪

701
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,030
remember? They are all dead.
没有的都是死人

702
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,210
It's that people who experience painful emotions
那些人经历痛苦情绪

703
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,660
but are all in the same time able to shift themselves,

00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,980
their consciousness, their thinking,
把自己 他们的意识 思想

705
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,210
their experience to the positive more readily.
他们的感受向积极方向转移

706
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,790
And happier people are more successful,
越快乐的人越成功

707
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,220
because they have more energy and work harder.
因为他们有更多精力 工作更努力

708
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,390
It's because their pursuing something
因为他们在追求

709
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,490
rather than running away from something--
而不是在逃离

710
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,370
it is called "approach rather than avoidance goals"--
这叫"靠近而非逃避目标"

711
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,220
we'll talk about that during the week on goals.
我们将在探讨"目标"时谈到

712
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,950
Also because they form better relationships.
还因为他们建立更好的人际关系

713
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,240
They are more open and generous.
他们更开放更宽容

714
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,940
And they are more creative.
他们的创造力更强

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,720
All these components ultimately lead to higher levels of success.
所有这些因素最终导致更高层次的成功

716
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,680
Positive emotions not only contribute to our success,
积极情绪不仅有助成功

717
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,350
they don't just contribute to our feeling good,
不仅能让我们感觉好

718
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,140
they also contribute to our wellbeing.
还有助我们获得幸福

00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,520
Optimistic people, and again,
乐观的人

720
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,420
not Pollyannaish detached optimism,
不是指盲目的乐天派

721
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,050

on average, live significantly longer.

723
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,780
Bless you.
保佑你们

724
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,370
The immune system is stronger,
免疫系统更强

725
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,270
so it also helps in terms of physical health.
所以对身体健康也有帮助

726
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:41,740
But now the question is the moral question:
现在的问题是 道德问题

727
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,390
What about other people?
那么其他人呢?

728
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,950
How can I talk about or act in my life,
我谈论经营自己的生活

729
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,880
pursuing my happiness isn't that selfish?
追求自己的快乐 这怎么不是自私?

730
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,110
Ant the answer is: "Yes, it is selfish."
答案是"是的 那是自私"

731
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,220
When I talk to myself, when I say to myself,
当我对自己说

732
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,880
"I want to be happier",
"我想更快乐"

733
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,640
I say to myself, "I want to be happier."
我对自己说"我想更快乐"

734
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,270
That' s a selfish thing.
那是一件自私的事

735
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
So it that bad? Is that immoral?
它是坏的吗?是不道德的吗?

736
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,510
Well, in our culture,
在我们的文化中

737
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,640
selfishness and immorality have essentially become synonymous.
自私和不道德成了同义词

738
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,200
And that's a problem.
那是个问题

739
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,170
And here's why. Because this is the No. 1--
这就是为什么 因为这是头号

740
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,940
equating to selfishness and immorality is the No. 1 cause--

741
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,930
subconsciously mostly, but not only--
多数是在潜意识里

742
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,100
No. 1 cause of unhappiness.
导致不快乐的头号原因

743
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,070
Because people feel guilty about pursuing their own happiness.
人们为追求自己的快乐感到内疚

744
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:46,500
People feel guilty at times feeling good about themselves.
人们在自我感觉很好时会内疚

745
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,170
How can I? How dare I feel good about myself?
我怎么可以? 我怎么敢自我感觉良好?

746
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,070
How can I pursue my happiness
我怎么能追求自己的快乐

747
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,890
when there is so much suffering in the world?
当世上有那么多痛苦时?

748
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,180
And there is a lot of suffering in the world.
世上确有很多痛苦

749
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,120
So how do we respond to that?
我们要如何回应?

750
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,390
First of all, happiness is a positive sum game--
首先 快乐是正和博弈

751
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,920
it's not a zero sum game.
不是零和博弈

752
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,880
Neither it is a negative sum game--
也不是负和博弈

753
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,410
it's not that my happiness takes away from other people's happiness
我的快乐不是从别人那里夺来

754
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,910
which will be a negative sum game:

if I have more, you'll necessarily have less.

It's not even a zero--

00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,390
or rather if I have less,

Why? Because happiness is contagious.

If you are happy, and work on your happiness,

781
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,250
since they are dead--

782
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,590

You know, one of the things that I say and only half ingest,

is that I know of no more selfish act and a benevolent act.

820
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,620
Again, only half ingest--
只说了一半意思

821
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,900
because the two are interconnected.

And there is a self-enforcing loop between the two,

00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,540
where helping others helps ourselves;

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,120
and helping ourselves, in turn, helps others.

825
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,850
And rather than looking it as selfish--

826
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,520
some people may feel this ease way--
有人可能会这样简单考虑

827
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,910
and rather than looking it as selfish i.e. -- equal immoral.

828
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,550
We should look at it as something

829
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,180
that is so wonderful about our nature,
人性的美妙之处

830
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,860
a part of our nature that we should celebrate.

832
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,660
the fact that we are tied to others in a web of empathy--

833
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,350
that's a wonderful thing about human nature.

834
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,260
A thing that we need to celebrate much more than we are doing already.
一样值得我们进一步颂扬的东西

835
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,290
Because remember, if we don't celebrate,
如果不颂场

836
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,540
if we don't appreciate that part of our nature,
如果我们不欣赏人性的那一部分

837
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,170
that part of our nature will depreciate.
人性的那一部分将贬值

838
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,300
To appreciate has two meanings as we talked about:
欣赏有两个意思

839
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,650
one is to say "thank you" for something and two is to grow.
一是懂得感谢 二是传递

840
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,730
If we appreciate the good in our nature,

841
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,680
in our inclinations,
欲望中好的东西

842
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,640
if we appreciate that part of our nature,
如果我们欣赏本性中那一部分

843
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,730
it will appreciate and we'll have more of it.
它将升值 我们将获得更多

844
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,850
If we look down at it and say,
如果我鄙视它并说

845
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,830
"It's a terrible thing that
"很可怕

846
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,430
I just derive benefits from helping other people",
我从帮助他人身上获得利益"

847
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,890
then that part of our nature will depreciate over time.
那么本性中那一部分将随时间贬值

848
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,450
For your readings, you are reading one of the meditations in my book,
你们正在读我书中的冥想部分

849
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,590
where I talk about it a little bit more in length,
书中有更详细的阐述

850
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,050
and I also gave the philosophical foundation,

851
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:11,130
because in many ways this goes against "counting and thinking"
因为在很多方面有别于"数数和思考"

852
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,010
that has been so dominant in our 20th and 21st century
那种方法在20和21世纪处于统治地位

853
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,040
thinking about morality.
思考道德

854
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,450
It feels good to feel good.
感谢好就是感觉好

855
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,320
It also contributes to others to feel good.
也能让他人感觉好

856
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,920
I want to end this premise idea
我想以介绍一位

857
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,610
by talking a little bit about a person for whom,

"Madam, can you please come back in a month?"

She didn't know why but she listened to him after all--

874
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,170

00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,340
but please bear with me.
但请忍耐

903
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,410
So-- if you don't feel comfortable doing it,
感觉不舒服的

904
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,540
don't do it-- what I'd like to do now is as following:
就不要做 希望按下面的指示做

905
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,910
Take your thumb and your middle finger
让你的姆指和中指

906
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,570
and create as much as possible a 90 degree angle.
尽可能形成一个直角

907
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,550
May hurt a little bit,
可能有点痛

908
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,730
but try as much as possible to create a 90 degree angle.
尽可能形成一个直角

909
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,690
Ok, watch me: Just like this, Ok?
看着我 就像这样

910
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,080
90 degree angle.
直角

911
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,070
Now take these two fingers--
再让这两个手指

912
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,860
the middle finger and the thumb--
中指和姆指

913
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:02,550
and as much as possible, from that 90 degree angle, create a circle.
尽可能保持直角时围成一个圆圈

914
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,030
Again, it's more difficult for men than for women--
男性比女性更难做到

915
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,840
less flexible.
男性的柔韧度更小

916
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,550
Create a circle.
围成一个圆圈

917
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,040
So it looks like a rabbit.
看上去像只兔子

918
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
If you have them on the show.
如果能投影的话

920
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,910
Alright, just watch me.
好 看着我

921
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,790
Like this. As much as possible.
像这样 尽可能围成一个圆圈

922
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,100
It's not perfectly round, but as much as possible.
不是完美的圆但要尽力

923
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,700
Now take that circle that you have just created--
把这个围起来的圆圈

924
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,420
Can you see? That's a circle.
看到吗? 这是个圆圈

925
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,840
Take that circle and put it on your cheek.
把这个圆圈放在面颊上

926
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,120
Your other cheek.
另一个地方

927
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,180
Ok, this could also take a while.
可能需要一会

928
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,190
But most people from what I see, put it on their chin.
我看到的多数同学都放在了下巴上

929
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,410
Now I said it very clearly, "cheek".
我很清楚地说是"面颊"

930
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,880
But you see, here is the thing:
问题就在这里

931
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,780
People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.
多数人都是照你做的做而不是照你说的做

932
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,420
So remember that,
请记住这一点

933
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:15,960
because I don't think there is anyone in this room
我不认为课堂上有任何人

934
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,240
who would tell me now,
会告诉我

935
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,940
"my goal in life, my objective is to make people miserable.
"我的人生目标是让别人不幸

936
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,000
I really want to do that.

937
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,920
You know I want everyone to be miserable in the world."
我想要世上所有人都不幸"

938
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:34,080
There is not one person here who would actually say that, I hope.
这里不会有人真得说出那种话 希望如此

939
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,770
So most of us here, whatever we do in our lives,
我们在座的多数人 不论做什么

940
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,410
now and in the future, are idealists.
从现在到未来 都是理想主义者

941
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,650
We want to do good in the world;
我们想为世人造福

942
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,250
we want to spread happiness.
想传播快乐

943
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,380
But remember, people do what you do,
但记住 人们照你做的做

944
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,220
not what you say.
不是照你说得做

945
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,600
So you may want to spread happiness, through your word.
你也许想传播快乐 通过你的言话

946
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,970
But ultimately, the best way,
但最好的方法

947
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:57,750
the optimal way spreading happiness is to work on your own happiness,
传播快乐的最佳方法是努力争取自己的快乐

948
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,130
because then you are leading by example.
因为那时你就成为榜样

949
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,320
That applies to leadership.
这也适用于领导

950
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,420
The most important thing about leadership is not what you say;
领导最重要的不是说的话

951
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,080
it's what you do.
而是如何以身作则

952
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,030
The most important thing about parenting--
为人父母最重要的

953
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,140
it's not how much you tell your child "honesty is important"
不是告诉子女"诚实很重要"

954
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,440
but rather how honest you are.
而是你自身有多诚实

955
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,220
If you want to spread happiness,
如果你想传播快乐

956
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,220
"Be the change you want to see in the world." By example.
"成为你想在世上见到的改变" 以身作则

957
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:35,360
So these are the five basic premises that we talked about.
这就是五个基本前提

958
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,880
They formed the foundation of the course.
它们构成这门课的基础

959
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,220
And what we are going to do over the next couple of month

960
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,770
is expand on these--
扩展这些前提

961
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,390
most importantly, see how we can take the research,

962
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:54,350
the rigor and apply it to our lives.
原则运用于生活

963
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,980
So let me move on now to the next lecture,
现在开始下一课

964
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,700
which is "Belief as Self-Fulfilling Prophecies".

965
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,660
This I must say,

966
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,280
this topic ignited my imagination

00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,570
And that's when I understood the power of the mind.

970
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:27,150
And that would pick my interests in psychology.
后来它挑起我对心理学的兴趣

971
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,100
I want to start with a story, a specific story,

972
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,640
that in many ways I can say it is the first story,

The story that I heard that brought home to me the message

977
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,850
was the most important thing in my life.

978
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,420
And the story is of Roger Bannister.
故事讲的是Roger Bannister

979
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,440
Just so I get a show of hands:

how many people have heard of Roger Bannister? Ok. A handful.

Was it new technologies, new shoes?

Look how powerful the mind is.
信念是多么强大

1047

and they say "Oops! We are over the speed limit!

physiologists and scientists had claimed.

There is unfortunately a lot of misunderstanding about optimism.

The source of the word, Pygmalion is ancient Greece.

Pygmalion was a sculptor.

I mean it's understandable--

and long before Harvard became co-ed.
远在哈佛成为男女合校之前

So he couldn't find his ideal woman and he went back to Athens.

00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,960
I will create a sculpture"-- as he was a sculptor,

And then Zeus, Athena and especially Aphrodite,

looking down on him, took mercy and brought the statue to life.

And of course, they lived happily ever after.

1135
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,470
So this is the source of the word, Pygmalion.
这是这个词的由来

1136
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:02,930
Pygmalion was then taken by George Bernard Shaw,

who created a play based on a similar idea

1143
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,970
was that she molded him more and transformed him.

Fascinating story and very important story at the time.

who thought they were better than they were really.

01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,960
Robert Rosenthal administered once again an IQ test

It was that they were alluded before.

1433
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:04,890

I'll share one study and then another later-- about the environment.
先说第一个再说第二个 关于环境

1445
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,550
First of all, the work of Barge,
首先是Barge的研究

1446
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,410
priming is when we have subconscious or conscious priming.
影射分为潜意识和有意识影射

1447
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:02,750
For example, you are looking at a screen

01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,090
There is a lot of research on
有很多关于如何利用

1451
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:13,860
how we can prime your negatively with stereotypes for example,
典型消极情况进行影射的研究 比如

1452
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,220
with prejudices.
使用偏见

1453
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:18,020
Or positively-- but not enough from positively.
或者积极的 但对积极影射的研究不够

1454
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,640
So here's a story done by Barge.
Barge做了下面的实验

1455
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:25,110
He primed people with words associated with old.
他用与"老"有关的词影射人

1456
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:28,560
So for example, word such as old,
比如"老"这个词

1457
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:36,120
word such as stick,
"拐杖"

1458
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:43,500
word such as Florida--
"佛罗里达"

1459
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,930
that's one of the words he primed people with.
他用这个词影射人们

1460
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:50,780
So he primed people with "old" words.
他用与老有关的词影射人们

1461
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:53,580
And then he had them take a comparative and control group
然后他对比他们和对照组的

1462
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:56,590
an intelligence test and a memory test.
智力和记忆力测试结果

1463
01:16:56,590 --> 01:17:01,120
The memory of the people who were primed with "old" words.
用与"老"相关的词影射过的人的记忆力

1464
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,070
They performed the worst than the control group.
他们的表现比对照组差

1465
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:13,840
Second, he looked at these people
第二 他观察这些人

1466
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,250
and measured how fast they walk from
记录他们从实验地点

1467
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:21,840
where their experiment was to the elevator.
走到电梯的时间

1468
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,890
And also had blind evaluators--
还找来盲测员

1469
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,840
people who didn't know which condition they were in,
那些不了解情况的人

1470
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:30,120
evaluate how they were walking.
评估他们的走路

1471
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,910
So the people who were primed with old actually walked
用"老"影射过的人行走起来

1472
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:37,440
more stoop than the other people.
真得比其他人更弯腰驼背

1473
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,150
And they walk significantly slower toward the elevator,
走向电梯的速度明显慢

1474
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:44,790
not knowing that they were primed with old words.
虽然不知道自己被与"老"相关的字影射过

1475
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,320
They walk slower toward the elevator.,
但他们走向电梯的速度

1476
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:53,680
then the people who were not primed with these old words,
比没有受到影响的人慢

1477
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:58,080
subconscious completely.
完全是潜意识的

1478
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,470
And then they did something priming people with words
然后他们用与"成就"相关的词

1479
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:02,130
related to an achievement.
