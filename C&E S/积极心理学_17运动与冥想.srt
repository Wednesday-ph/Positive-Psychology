Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: Hi.Good morning.
大家早上好

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,940
We are going to pick up where we are left of last time.
我们接着讲上节课没讲完的内容

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,600
But before we do,a few of you came to me after the class
开始讲之前 上节课后有同学来找我

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,510
and asked about alternative form of exercise.
问我有没有其他的运动选择

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,410
So the study that I gave and also what you read-
我上次讲的研究 希望大家也去看看

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,650
the article by Callaghan and others,
就是Callaghan等人写的那篇文章

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,240
is mostly about aerobic exercise.
里面侧重讲的是有氧运动

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,080
And as I mentioned earlier,
我之前也提过

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,240
this is about moderate intensity workout,
做这运动的目的是缓和高强度运动

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,190
which would mean if you want to work with pulse about 70 percent,
做这种运动 你会达到最大心率的70%

29
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,010
between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum heart rate-
大约在最大心率的65%到75%之间

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,550
again you just Google heart rate exercise,
大家搜索心率运动

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,040
you'll immediately get all the tables that you need.
就能马上得到想查的各种心率表

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,890
But that's one form of exercise.
这是其中一种运动形式

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,560
Some of you asked,
有些同学问

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,310
"what about weight training? What about interval training?"
"举重训练行不行 间歇训练行不行?"

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,430
So sprints and stop.Sprints and stop.
快跑 休息 再快跑 再休息

36
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,860
Something that you know the crew team does often,
这种是划艇队经常做的训练

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,340
athletes do often.
运动员经常做的训练

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,670
What about this form?
这些运动行不行?

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,120
The reason why I didn't bring it up explicitly in the lecture is
我上节课没有专门提出

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,110
because the jury is still out on the different forms of exercise.
是因为目前对其他的运动还没有定论

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,650
But let me tell you
我可以告诉大家

42
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,090
what are some of the trends that we see in research.
目前在研究中发现的一些趋势

43
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,120
Right now it seems that
目前看来

44
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,200
if there's only one form of exercise that you do,
如果你只能做一种运动

45
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,260
the best bank for the buck,
那么最佳选择

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,100
best value for your time would be aerobic exercise.
时间最花得其所的是有氧运动

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,600
3,ideally 4 times,30 minutes of aerobic exercise a week.
理想地每周三四次半小时的有氧运动

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,300
That's at minimum.
这是最低要求

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,850
However,however,
但是

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,940
if you can also do weight training and supplement the physic...
如果你还能做举重训练以补充

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,110
the aerobic exercise,that's terrific.That's great.
有氧运动 那也很好

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,950
Twice a week,3 times of weight training is great,
一周两三次举动训练非常好

53
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,820
especially as you get older.
尤其是年纪大了以后

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,760
That...Weight training contributes more.
举重训练更加有用

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,780
But also at a very young age,weight training is good.
但在年轻时 举重训练也很好

56
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,290
However,it is not a replacement for aerobic exercise.
但是 它不能代替有氧运动

57
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,240
It hasn't shown to have the same psychological effect
研究发现它改善心理健康的效果

58
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,370
as aerobic exercise does.
不如有氧运动

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,690
The other form of exercise and it has been studied-
另外一种运动 在经过研究后…

60
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,190
again these are all tentative results;
我要重申 这些都是初步结果

61
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,990
there've been pilot studies about it.
有人对这种运动做过初步研究

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,580
The ends,
最后结果

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,830
the sample sizes are not large enough yet to say definitively,
因为样本不足 暂时无法下确切结论

64
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,510
just like we can say about aerobic exercise,
但我们可以确切地说有氧运动

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,270
it has similar effect
产生的效果能媲美

66
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,170
to some of our most powerful psychiatric drugs.
一些强效精神病药物

67
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,640
That's definitive- there are tons of studies on it
这个结论是确切的 有大量研究来支持

68
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,660
ever since Babyak in 2000 as well as before.
包括Babyak2000年以来的研究 以及之前的

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,520
But another form of exercise that has begun to be studied
另一种开始被研究的运动

70
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,230
with some very promising results is interval training.
得出可喜的结果 那就是间歇运动

71
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,500
Interval training would be,say,running at,
间歇运动就是 以跑步为例子

72
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,450
between 90 and 95 percent of your maximum heart rate.
达到最大心率的90%到95%

73
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,710
So if you are 20,your maximum heart rate would be,would be 200,
如果你20岁 你最大心率就是200

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,780
because it's 220 minus your age.
计算公式是220减去年龄

75
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,610
Then you need to be running at around at 180 to 190 pulse rate,
所以你跑步的心率要达到180到190

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,870
which is hard,which is tough,
强度非常高

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,910
which you can't do for a very long time.
不能持续很长时间

78
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,780
But doing it for as little as 30 seconds up to a minute
但如果能持续30秒到一分钟

79
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,140
and then resting,
然后休息

80
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,340
letting your heart rate go back down to 60 percent
让你的心率下降到最大心率的60%

81
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,640
of its maximum say 120,and then doing another interval.
也就是120 然后重复这个间歇运动

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,130
That has been shown with pilot studies only
有初步研究表明这种运动

83
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,450
to have remarkable effects.
能产生显著效果

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,290
In fact,often more powerful than aerobic exercise on its own,
通常效果甚至比单纯做有氧运动更大

85
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,290
and lasts for even longer- the effect.
而且持续时间更长

86
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,640
So- again,
所以 再说回来

87
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,260
I did not introduce it officially as part of the class,
我没有在课堂上正式介绍这种运动

88
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,690
but since many of you asked,I am introducing it.
但很多同学问起 所以现在介绍一下

89
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,540
Because I want to introduce you only things
因为我只想给大家介绍

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,240
that are with very robust results.
那些有确切结论的运动

91
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,460
John Ratey talks about this.
John Ratey也谈过这种运动

92
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,300
And I'll talk a little bit about John Ratey in a minute.
我等一下会讲John Ratey

93
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,450
He's the Harvard Medical psychatrist
他是哈佛医学院的精神医生

94
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,210
who is probably the leading proponent in research
可以说他是一个前沿的倡导者

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,770
in the area of exercise and mental health.
在研究运动和精神健康这个领域

96
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,450
And he himself- even though the results are still tentative,
他本身…虽然目前的结果是初步的

97
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,200
he introduces two interval trainings a week.
但他一周会做两次间歇运动

98
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,670
So in addition to working out six days a week,
除了一周做六天运动以外

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,060
two of them include full out sprinting,rest,
其中两天还会做全速短跑 休息

100
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,770
full out sprinting,rest.
全速短跑 休息

101
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,230
And what they've shown was that even less time than 30 minutes,
研究表明即使没有做够30分钟

102
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,830
you can get the same effect,
但还能得到同等的效果

103
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,120
the same psychological effect and even better.
同等的甚至更好的心理效果

104
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,520
What I do twice a week: I introduce interval training.
我一周也会做两次间歇运动

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,080
So for example,
所以 举个例子

106
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,230
this morning when I was on my trampoline,I did it for 30 minutes.
今天早上我在蹦床上跳了30分钟

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,850
And out of the 30 minutes,there were 4 sprints.
在这30分钟里 我还做了4个短跑

108
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,870
Indeed.(Laughter)
没错

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,090
You don't believe that I do trampoline,do you?
你们不相信我会跳蹦床 是吧?

110
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,670
I'll videotape it and I'll...Maybe not.Maybe not.
我下次拍下来 还是不要了

111
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,650
So 4 sessions of sprints,and I have my heart monitor on,
4次短跑 我戴着心率监测仪

112
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,390
going all way- for me it's about 165 heart rate,
快速跑一段 我的心率大约是165

113
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:10,080
between 165 and 170,and then resting,going back to about 110,
165到170之间 然后休息 下降到110

114
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,500
which is less than 60 percent of my maximum,
少于我最大心率的60%

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,420
and then doing it four times.
如此重复四次

116
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,720
And for the rest of the 30 minutes,
这30分钟里其余的时间

117
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,410
I just do moderate aerobic exercise.
我只做缓和的有氧运动

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,620
So I also introduce the interval training.
所以我也做间歇运动

119
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,870
The weight training I do less of,because I get that from Yoga-
举重训练就比较少做 因为我做瑜伽时

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,880
a lot of the strengthening exercises.
就有这种加强体能的效果

121
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,570
The most important thing though that
但最重要的一点是

122
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,330
I do want to say about interval training
我想说 间歇运动

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,860
is that, especially for perfectionists,
特别是对于完美主义者来说

124
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,470
it's very easy to over-train.
很容易导致训练过度

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,250
You don't want to get to your maximum heart rate
大家最好不要达到最大心率

126
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,130
and keep it there for a long time,even if you can.
并且持续一段长时间 即使你做得来

127
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,640
More does not necessarily mean better.
更多并不意味着更好

128
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,300
Again,unless you are training for Olympics,
再说一次 除非你是备战奥运

129
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,680
in which case you do want to get to
这种情况下有时你就要达到

130
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,270
100 percent of your maximum heart rate at times,
100%的最高心率

131
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,410
for maximum health you want to get to 90 percent,
想练出最健康的身体 达到90%…

132
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,710
maximum 95 percent of your maximum heart rate,
最大心率的95%就行了

133
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,790
which is why a heart rate monitor can help so much.
所以戴上心率监测仪就很有用

134
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,340
Because it can tell you when you are working too hard
因为它能告诉你 运动是否强度太大

135
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,360
or when it's too easy.
或者强度不足

136
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,060
Bottom line: variety is good for exercise.
总之 换换花样有助于运动

137
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,520
If you can introduce dancing,it's great exercise.
你可以跳舞 这也是好运动

138
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,670
If you can introduce,once in a while working in the gym,
你可以 偶尔去健身室健身

139
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,620
once in a while playing basketball,
偶尔打篮球

140
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,120
rowing- the more variety,the better.
划艇 花样越多越好

141
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,270
But the foundation: at least we,ideally 4 times a week,
只要保证 至少对我们来说 一周四次

142
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,470
30 minutes of aerobic exercise.
一次30分钟的有氧运动

143
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,440
So we stopped last time with overcoming barriers.
上节课我们讲到克服障碍

144
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,250
And some of the barriers are that
其中一些障碍包括

145
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,090

your creativity levels go up; your concentration,

193
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,730
A,because I don't have the rituals;

and B,because I wasn't as focused,

especially during a stressful period such as exam period.

克服时间不足这个问题

199
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,130
is not relying on self-discipline.
不能靠自律

200
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,840
We have established that before;
我们之前已经讲过了

we saw the research- we have a limited amount of self-discipline.
我们看过那个研究 人的自律是有限的

say,3 mornings during the week you'll do it;

or if a good time for you is the afternoon or evening,

205
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,060
but have a ritual around it.

206
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,860
Another barrier to exercising regularly-

207
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,710
this is an interesting one and often overlooked

but extremely powerful- and that is the subconscious barrier.

209
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,020
Nathaniel Branden talks about this
Nathaniel Branden谈过这点

210
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,840
and I talked about it a little bit in my book,quoting him.
我在我的书中也略谈过 引用了他的话

211
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,330
He talks about self-esteem and
他谈到自尊

212
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,660
part of self-esteem is the notion that we are worthy of happiness
自尊隐含了一个概念:我们值得拥有幸福

213
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,730
The notion of being worthy of happiness.
值得拥有幸福

214
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,670
And when you ask people,"are you worthy of happiness?"
当你问别人"你值得拥有幸福吗?"

215
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,160
Most people would say,"yes." But if you ask the subconscious,
大部人会说"值得" 但在潜意识中

216
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,690
very often,for many people,it's "no",
通常很多人都会说"不值得"

217
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,910
whether it's because of the voice that we heard in the past
可能因为脑袋里有一把声音说"不值得"

218
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,310
from teachers,educators,parents,significant adults,
因为过去老师 教育工作者 父母 重要的大人

219
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,510
society at large by comparing us to unrealistic models.
社会大众都要我们向不现实的榜样看齐

220
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,980
But very often we have this voice,the subconscious level that
所以通常在我们潜意识里有一把声音说

221
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,460
"we are not really worthy of happiness".
"我不值得拥有幸福"

222
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,120
And that is a barrier; that stops us from becoming happier.
这是一个障碍 使我们无法更快乐

223
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,840
Now one of the things that we know of exercise is that
我们知道运动的其中一个作用就是

224
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,440
it's one of the- if not the most power drug for making us happier
可以说它是让我们变幸福的最强效药物

225
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,630
Now I know that exercise makes me happier; it makes me feel good.
我知道运动使人幸福 使人感觉良好

226
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,830
But if my subconscious thinks that
但如果我的潜意识认为

227
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,810
I'm unworthy of these feelings,unworthy of being happy,
我不值得拥有这些感觉 不值得幸福

228
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,400
it may in fact stop me from exercising.
它可能阻止我运动

229
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,970
Why? Because remember,
为什么?因为 大家回忆一下

230
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,960
mind doesn't like when there is an inconsistency
意识不喜欢

231
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,780
between what's inside and what's outside.
潜意识与外界不一致

232
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,470
And if what's inside is saying "shouldn't be happy"
如果我潜意识认为"不应该快乐"

233
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,460
then I try to match it to what's inside.
我就会听从我的潜意识

234
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,570
And I don't exercise.
我就不会运动

235
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,610
Because if I do exercise,then there will be a disconnect-
因为我运动的话 就会与潜意识不一致

236
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll be happier than I think I'm worthy of.
我会比潜意识认为的更幸福

237
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,040
There's a lot of research on this.
在这个问题上有过很多研究

238
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,230
For example,by psychologist Bill Swann,
例如 心理学家Bill Swann

239
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,640
who talks about self-confirmation theory,
讲过自我确认理论

240
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,450
which is a very powerful force within us.
这是我们意识里一股很强大的力量

241
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,690
There's a self-enhancement,
我们意识里有自我提高

242
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,160
that we want to appear good in other people's eyes,in our eyes,
我们想在别人和自己眼里表现出好的一面

243
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,620
but there is a counter-force,which is self-confirmation
但还有一股反作用力 就是自我确认

244
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,600
where we want to confirm whatever we think about ourselves.
我们想确认对自己的了解是否属实

245
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,550
And if we think we are not worthy of happiness,
如果我们认为自己不值得幸福

246
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,390
we very often not do things that actually make us happy.
通常我们就不会做让自己幸福的事

247
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
We see it in other areas- in relationships,for example.
在其他方面也存在 例如在恋情中

248
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,440
If I think I'm unworthy of a wonderful partner,
如果我认为我不值得拥有好伴侣

249
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,310
of being happy in relationships,
不值得在恋情中得到幸福

250
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,020
very often I'll often inadvertently subconscious working here,
通常我就会在潜意识里

251
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,290
jeopardize the relationship
破坏这段恋情

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,280
and look for things that are not working,actively,
积极寻找恋情中不顺利的地方

253
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,550
subconsciously look for ways of hurting the relationship.
潜意识中寻找方法伤害这段恋情

254
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,950
So we need to be aware of the subconscious level.
所以我们需要注意这些潜意识力量

255
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,040
And very much it applies to whether or not we exercise.
通常它能影响我们会不会去做运动

256
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,340
So what do we do with this? A best thing to do is to just do it.
我们该拿它怎么办?最好的办法就是运动

257
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Again,ritualize it.
再一次说回来 把它规律化

258
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,100
Not analyze it too much.Just go ahead and exercise.
不要分析太多 尽管去运动就行了

259
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,520
You know 3,4 times a week is good for you,just do it.
你知道一周三四次运动对你有益 尽管去做

260
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,120
And again it's the five-minute take-off that
再一次说到 即想即做法

261
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,900
subconscious mind will try to tell you,
潜意识会告诉你

262
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,340
"don't do it.You don't have the time.There are other things.
"不要做 你没时间 还有别的事要做

263
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,990
You'll do it tomorrow.Next week you'll start the regime."
你明天再做 你下周再开始定期运动"

264
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,040
The subconscious mind is very smart in its attempt,and
为了达到目的 潜意识会很聪明地

265
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,860
will do anything that it can almost to create this congruency.
用尽各种方法 几乎能使你的行动听从潜意识

266
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,840
When you go out and exercise and you show yourself,
当你出去运动时 你就让自己看到

267
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,150
"yes I'm worthy of happiness."
"是的 我值得拥有幸福"

268
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,400
Very often the subconscious mind will follow suit.
通常潜意识就会听从这个想法

269
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,630
So just do it.
所以尽管去运动

270
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,800
The second thing is recognize.This is on the cognitive level.
第二个是认识 这是认知层面的

271
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,280
Recognize how important physical exercise is.
认识运动的重要性

272
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,760
Remember what Martin Seligman said,"we mostly focus on neck up"-
大家回忆Martin Seligman说的"大部分人都专注于脖子以上"

273
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,300
and we do it as psychologists,
心理学家是这样

274
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,350
we do it as students in academic institution,
学术机构里的学生是这样

275
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,910
especially in a place like this.
尤其是在这样的学校里

276
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,250
So much about thinking and cognition.
大过专注于思考和认知

277
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,180
That's how you got here.That's how you were successful.
你们也正因此才能考上哈佛 才能成功

278
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,680
But it's no less important to think about neck down.
但专注于脖子以下 也同样重要

279
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,810
In fact,the mind alone can only take us so far
事实上 要获得幸福 脑袋的作用

280
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,100
when it comes to happiness,which is why I told you
是有限的 所以我要告诉大家

281
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,880
if I were a therapist,a pre-requisite for me to treat people
如果我是心理医生 我治人的第一件事就是

282
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,380
would be to have them exercise regularly.
要求他们运动

283
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,320
Because I don't want to fight nature.

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,900
I want to work with nature and build on it.

285
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,650
Exercise in many ways

I got injured,playing squash,my back.

They told me Yoga would help.I started Yoga.

435
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:16,530
I'm doing my teacher training now with Debbie Cohen,

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,810
Let me mention a few of them.
我们来提其中几个

444
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,980
First of all,it's focusing on one thing,
首先 它们都专注于一件事物上

445
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,720
whether it's the movement,whether it's the posture,
可以是动作 姿势

446
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,550
whether it's the breath,
呼吸

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,970
whether it's compassion and loving and kindness,

whether it's a flame.

Whatever it is,but it's focusing...

Whether it's a prayer.It's focusing on one thing.
可以是祈祷 反正就是一件事物上

Usually most forms of meditation-

the foundation is deep breathing.
基础都是深呼吸

453
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,720
In a sense the way a baby breathes.
就像婴儿呼吸一样

454
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,300
Belly breathing- breathe all the way to your belly
用腹部呼吸 把气一直吸进腹部

455
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,730
and then slowly,gently,gracefully breathing out.

And finally,there is no good or bad meditation.

459
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,280

when you are meditating.

You are giving yourself the permission to be human.

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,700
There is no "ah I just had an amazing meditation,"

463
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,080
or "I just feel enlightened."

In fact,let me tell you a story about

how I became enlightened through meditation.

We lived in Israel,

but I travelled once a month on average to the US for a few days.

And when I travelled here,

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,290
I used to give talks but also used that time as a form of retreat

And what I would do was I practiced a lot of Yoga,

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,790
much more than I did in Israel.

I just give you the context.

And the view is just breath-taking.

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,750
You know Israel is just a very tiny country,so you can see...
以色列是一个很小的国家

483
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,630
I can see both sides of Israel- the Mediterranean on one side;

I can see the Mountains of Samir on the other side.

And one of the things that I like to do is every morning-

because I'm a morning person-

I wake up usually before the rest of the family.

Since it's so high,

it's fortified glass of course and part of it does not open.

494
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,870
But I look through the part that does not open outside.

And I do it very often.

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,030
And I remember coming back from this particular trip and,

The world seems so much clear.

500
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,940
And I say to myself,"wow.I must've become enlightened."

501
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,490
Because I read in books and I heard people talking about it

that when you become enlightened,everything becomes clear.

The world becomes even more beautiful than it already is.

504
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,230

I've been meditating for over ten years,

don't go around telling people they are enlightened.

But...So I didn't tell anyone.

I didn't even tell Tammy that I'm enlightened.

I would wake up and again my ritual observation on off

the mountains in a distance and I said,

"wow.The world is so beautiful.I'm enlightened."

And that went on for a few days.

522
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,140
and just chatting.
我们在聊天

523
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,400
And you know she was looking outside and I was looking outside.

524
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,120
And she said,"you know finally when you went away,

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,540
after so long,I finally was able to clean the window."[Laugh]

I said,I said,"what?"

527
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,150
And she said,"you know I haven't been able to get out there.

528
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,770

So much for my enlightenment.
我的觉悟原来是一场空欢喜

532
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,150
So you know,maybe there is enlightenment- I don't know.
也许真的有觉悟这回事 我也不知道

533
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,910
But the key with meditation is not about reaching that stage,
但冥想的关键并不是达到这种境界

534
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,740
when everything suddenly becomes so clear.
看到一切都变明亮了

535
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,430
You know I think the quicker path would be to clean the window.
要想这样 把窗户擦干净可能更快

536
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,950
But that's not what meditation is about.

537
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,560
Meditation is about being present,being in the here and now,

struggling with being in the here and now.

And when we lose our thought,

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,020
when we lose our focus on the breath,simply bring it back.
当我们对呼吸分心了 集中回来就行了

541
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,320
That is the practice- losing it and bringing it back.
这就是冥想 分心 集中

542
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,940
Losing it and bringing it back.
分心 集中

543
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,420
And that's how we exercise our mind to be more focused,
这样我们就能把思想锻炼得更专注

544
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,000
to be more mindful.
更留神

545
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,180

00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,740
So they did.And they brought them in.
他们找到了 把这些人找来

576
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,080
And what they looked for,the first thing,remember,
他们研究的第一样东西是 大家应该记得

577
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,110
left to right prefrontal cortex ratio.
左前额皮层和右前额皮层的比例

578
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,120
And if you remember,we talked about it-
大家记得 我们之前谈过

579
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,820
people who are happier generally have more activation
快乐的人通常更活跃的地方

580
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,500
on the left side of the prefrontal cortex;
是左前额皮层

581
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,140
people who are less happy have more activation
不快乐的人更活跃的地方

582
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,680
on the right side of the prefrontal cortex.
是右前额皮层

583
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,120
So that ratio is important.
所以这个比例很重要

584
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,570
And it's one of the "objective" means of measuring happiness.
它是测量快乐的一个"客观"手段

585
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,680
One of the things that they have found is that
他们得出的一个发现是

586
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,160
there is very high correlation
两者之间存在很大关联

587
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,690
between what our brains look like under the scanner
在扫描器下看到的大脑

588
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:30,570
and our self-report about how happy we are-
和我们对自己是否快乐的自我报告

589
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,660
not 100 percent correlation,not at 1,but pretty high,
当然不是100%的关联 但也不低 很高

590
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,330
suggesting the self-reports are pretty,are quite reliable.
这表明自我报告是很可靠的

591
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,220
But anyway,so they wanted to look at the brain of the meditators
总之 他们想研究这些冥想者的大脑

592
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,580
And when they looked at the general public,
他们再比较普通大众

593
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,100
we all exist on a Bell curve.
我们都在一个钟形曲线内

594
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,170
The happier people are further on
快乐的人更靠前

595
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,260
more activation on the left side;
左侧皮层更活跃

596
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,960
the less happy people are further-
不快乐的人更靠后

597
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,920
more activation,higher ratio on the right side.
右侧皮层更活跃

598
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,540
And then they brought in the meditators.
然后他们找来这些冥想者

599
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,650
And they measured their left to right prefrontal cortex.
测出他们左前额皮层和左前额皮层的比例

600
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,200
And here is what they found.
这是他们的研究发现

601
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,530
This is the normal Bell curve.
这是正常的钟形曲线

602
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,700
This is where the meditators were.
冥想者在这里

603
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,900
This is from 2001- since,they have found numerous meditators
这是2001年的研究 他们找了很多冥想者

604
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,880
that are quite literally off the chart,
他们几乎偏离了这个图

605
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,600
suggesting very high levels of well being and happiness.
表明快乐的程度很高

606
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,990
Being susceptible to positive emotions,

607
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,380
and resilient in the face of painful emotions.

608
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,080
So this is a remarkable result.
这是一个很惊人的结果

609
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,200
Again,results that are not seen before
这些结果之前没人发现过

610
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,030
until they measured these meditators.
直到他们研究了这些冥想者

611
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,860
The other things that
另一个研究方面就是

612
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,370
they were interested is looking at other important indicator
他们想看看另一个重要的指标

613
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,140
for well being and calmness is the startle response.
衡量健康和冷静的惊吓反应

614
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,840
When you hear a bang,you startle.
当你听到一声巨响 你会吓一跳

615
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,280
And the startle response is important,
这个惊吓反应很重要

616
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,040
because the easier you get startled,
因为你越容易受到惊吓

617
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,490
generally it's correlated to the higher levels of anxiety,
通常说明你焦虑程度更高

618
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,000
susceptibility at least to anxiety.
至少容易产生焦虑

619
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,110
And everyone has this startle response to some degree.
大家都有一定的惊吓反应

620
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,080
Even marksmen and women in the military,
即使是军队里的神枪手

621
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,320
you know,who shoot their guns everyday

622
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,860
and they are trying to remain completely focus.

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,390
Even they startle,when the gun goes off.
当枪走火时 他们也会受到惊吓

624
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,690
They flinch.Very slightly,but they do.
他们会微微地抖一下 这也是惊吓反应

625
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,200
So it's impossible to suppress the startle response.
要压抑惊吓反应是不可能的

626
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,760
Or so they thought.
或者说当时的人是这样想的

627
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,880
When Paul Ackerman brought these meditators in
Paul Ackerman找来这些冥想者

628
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,440
and asked them to maintain complete equanimity and calmness,

629
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,940
and he startled them.
他吓他们

630
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:48,710
There was no reaction whatsoever.First time in recorded history.
他们一点反应都没有 有记录以来第一次

631
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,550
That people are,have been able to suppress the startle response.
有人能够抑压自己的惊吓反应

632
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,330
Here was what Daniel Goleman writes about this in his book,
Goleman writes在他的书中这样写道

633
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,960
Destructive Emotions: "Given that the larger someone's startle,
破坏性情绪 "一个人惊吓反应越大

634
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,880
the more intensely that
那个人就越可能

635
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,430
person tends to experience upsetting emotions,
出现消极情绪

636
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,810
Oser's performance had tantalizing implications,
Oser的表现有着有趣的含意

637
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,110
suggesting a remarkable level of emotional equanimity."
表明他的情绪有着惊人的镇定"

638
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,750
That equanimity was also contagious-
这种镇定还会传染

639
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,040
so people who tried to argue with these monks,
如果有人想和这些喇嘛争吵

640
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,510
very often had a hard time becoming angry or upset
他们会很难生起气来

641
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,640
even if the topic was upset,personally upsetting to them,
即使这个话题很容易让他们生气

642
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,920
such as scientists arguing about the existence of God.
例如科学家争论上帝是否存在

643
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,290
And they said,"I couldn't get upset."
他们说"我生不起气来"

644
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,220
Because calm is contagious,just like happiness is.
因为平静是会传染的 就是快乐会传染一样

645
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,020
Now some of you may not be 100 percent clear about
有些同学可能不百分百了解

646
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,320
what the startle response is.
什么是惊吓反应

647
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,830
So for those of you who are not,I've prepared a very brief clip.
对于不了解惊吓反应的同学 我准备了一个短片

648
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,730
[VIDEO: Clip on Startle Response]
(惊吓反应视频)

649
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,270
Oh sure the mask doesn't do anything to him.
面具吓不了他

650
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,770
But you wanna see something really scary?

651
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,950
It's Dad![Laugh]

652
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,940
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: OK.All right.Now you understand.
好了 现在大家明白了

653
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,870
When they studied these meditators,
他们研究这些冥想者时

654
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,840
essentially what they were doing was applying
基本上他们方法就是应用

655
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,550
what we've talked about,

657
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,270
the growing tip statistic- studying the best.
生长锥数据 研究最好的

658
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,460
Because if you want to advance knowledge,
因为如果你想推动知识发展

659
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,980
if you want to better apply ideas that work,

660
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,590
you don't study the average teacher,you study Marva Colins.
你不会研究普通老师 你会研究Marva Colins

661
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,650
You don't study the average meditator,

662
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,640
who thinks he's enlightened,you study the meditators

664
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,530
Lama Oser,one of these meditators:
其中一个冥想者Oser喇嘛说

665
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,970
"The process itself has some extraordinary qualities,
"冥想本身有一些与众不同的特质

666
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,380
but not necessarily the subject.
但这与进行冥想的人无关

667
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,770
The important idea is that this process is within the reach of
重要的一点是 冥想并非触不可及的

668
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,670
anyone who applies himself or herself with enough determination."
只要你有足够的决心来练习它"

669
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,220
In other words,this is not just for the selected few,
也就是说 冥想并不专属于少数几个人

670
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,960
who can meditate for 30 years,8 hours a day.
那些每天8小时地冥想了30年的人

671
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,870
It can be applied
大家都可以冥想

672
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,280
because the process is relatively simple to all of us.
因为这个过程对所有人来说都很简单

673
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,430
Daniel Goleman: "From the perspective of neuroscience,
Daniel Goleman说"从神经科学的角度看

674
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,730
the point of all this research
这个研究的重点

675
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,970
has nothing to do with demonstrating that
并不是为了说明

676
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,750
Oser or any other extraordinary person
Oser或者其他厉害的冥想者

677
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,640
may be remarkable in him-or herself,but
本身有什么过人之处

678
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,540
rather to stretch the field's assumptions about human possibility
而是为了扩展这个领域对于人体潜力的假设

679
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,650
Some of these key assumptions have already begun to expand,
其中一些关键假设已经开始扩展了

680
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,490
in part due to a revolution in neuroscience's supposition
部分原因是神经科学

681
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,110
about the malleability of the brain itself."
对大脑可塑性作出革命性猜想"

682
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,370
Remember neuroplasticity.Neurogenesis.
大家记住 神经塑性 神经形成

683
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,950
These concepts that I and...
这些概念 我和

684
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,020
how scientists like Richie Davidson identified
像Richie Davidson这样的科学家认为

685
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,470
that our brain is malleable,it can change.
大脑是可塑的 可以改变的

686
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,120
And one of the ways to change it is through meditation.
改变的方法之一就是冥想

687
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,970
Now this is all well and good.
这种观点非常好

688
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,630
So we can apply this process with determination to our lives.
所以我们可以下决心把它应用于生活中

689
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,150
But how many people here seriously would say,
但这课室里有多少人会认真地说

690
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,440
"OK.That sounds great.
"听起来很好

691
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,720
I want my left side of the prefrontal cortex to be more active.
我想我的左前额皮层更活跃

692
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,030
So I'm gonna go off to Himalayas
所以我要去喜马拉雅山

693
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,370
and meditate for 30 years,8 hours a day.
每天8小时地冥想30年"

694
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,920
I mean,how many people are really prepared to do this?
有多少人真的准备这么做?

695
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,450
How many people have time for 2 hours a day of meditation?
有多少人每天有两小时做冥想?

696
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,550
The second problem with this research is that it's correlational.
这个研究的第二个问题是 两者之间只是关联

697
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,740
There's no causation here.
但并没有因果关系

698
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,630
Maybe Lama Oser was born that way;
也许Oser喇嘛天生就是这样

699
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,990
that's why he was attracted to meditation.
所以他才对冥想产生兴趣

700
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,550
Maybe Matthieu Ricard- he's written a book on happiness-
也许Matthieu Ricard…他写了一本关于幸福的书

701
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,700
Dalai Lama's translator,right-hand man.
他是达赖喇嘛的翻译 一个右撇子

702
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Maybe he was born that way
也许他天生就是这样

703
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,270
with a remarkable left to right prefrontal cortex.
左前额皮层比右前额皮层活跃得多

704
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,030
He's,by the way,literally off the charts.
对了 他的比例完全超出钟形曲线

705
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,820
But the main problem still remains- beyond causation is the time.
除了因果关系 还有一个主要问题 时间

706
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,670
Do we have the time,
我们有时间吗

707
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,280
do we have the patience to meditate so often and so much?
我们有耐心经常长时间冥想吗?

708
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,670
You know when I found out,when I started to meditate,
我发现当我开始冥想

709
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,970
to do Yoga,I really saw the benefits of it.
开始做瑜伽时 我真的能看到益处

710
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,920
And I said,"OK.So I'm getting the benefits
我说"我每天做半小时

711
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,060
when I am doing it for half an hour a day.
就能收到成效了

712
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,010
What if I do a real,longer retreat?"
如果我进行一次长时间静修呢?"

713
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,670
And I have some great 10 day long retreats.
所以我想进行十天的静修

714
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,790
And I said to Tammy,
我跟Tammy

715
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,010
"you know,I want to go to a 10 day retreat."
"我想去静修十天"

716
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,520
And Tammy knows me pretty well,
Tammy很了解我

717
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,990
and she said,"you know,why don't you try...
她说"不如你试试…

718
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,370
You know it's not all or nothing.

45 minutes a day of meditation.

the group that was waiting for a retreat,waiting for the lessons

people who wanted to do meditation.

"well,it's not enough- just self-reported could be placebo,"-

but he wanted to see something else beyond just placebo.

if you want to get a good outline of what the field has to say
如果你想对这个领域有一个深刻的初步认识

897
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,980
is called The Mindful Way Through Depression.
我推荐大家看《改善情绪的正念疗法》

898
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:08,710
It talks about
这本书是讲

899
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,460
how mindfulness can help us overcome major depression,
意念如何能帮我们克服严重抑郁

900
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:17,730
mild depression as well as things like anxiety

901
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,640
and how it can also help other psychological disorders.
还能改善其他心理疾病

902
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,740
And one of the things for example that they show there-
例如这本书中讲到的一件事

903
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,080
we know from,
我们知道

904
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,150
unfortunately we know that once someone has major depression,
很不幸 一旦一个人患了严重抑郁

905
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:34,120
the likelihood of it reappearing,
复发的可能

906
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,550
whether it's a month later or sometimes years later
不管是一周后 还是一年后

907
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:40,640
is much higher than if we never have major depression.
比从来没患过严重抑郁的人要高很多

908
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,360
Why? Think about what we have discussed before.
为什么?回忆一下我们之前讲过的内容

909
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,860
What we talked about is how the brain creates neural pathways.
我们讲过大脑是如何形成神经通路的

910
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,850
Now if a neural pathway has been created-
一旦神经通路形成

911
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,460
and it's a strong neural pathway of depression,
因为抑郁症的神经通路很强烈

912
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,710
very often something which is relatively mild
通常一点相对不严重的事发生了

913
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,860
but happens can send us back to that neural pathway.
都能让这条神经通路活跃过来

914
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,630
So we through a relatively hard period,nothing that serious,but
如果我们有一段时间情绪不好 哪怕是一点小事

915
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,010
immediately the brain looks for that the largest neural pathway,
马上大脑就会寻找最大的那条神经通路

916
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,750
the largest river metaphorically speaking.
形象一点说 最大的那条河流

917
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,420
And it goes there.
它就会找到那条通路

918
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:20,780
And we have the major depression again with little reason.
所以因为一点很小的原因 严重抑郁症复发了

919
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,970
And after we have it two or three times,
复发了两三次后

920
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,380
the neural pathway is even stronger,even more likely to recur.
这条神经通道更强烈了 复发可能性更高了

921
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:36,310
What he found when they introduced mindfulness meditation or
他发现 当他们进行正念冥想

922
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,780
mindfulness therapy in addition to cognitive behavioral therapy
或者正念疗法 再配以认知行为疗法

923
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:44,090
was it reduced the likelihood of recurrence of major depression
就能减少严重抑郁症复发的可能

924
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,160
among people who have major depression or had major depression-
那些患有 或曾经患过严重抑郁症的人

925
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,680
reduces the likelihood by over 50 percent of relapse.
能减少50%的复发可能

926
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,320
That is a longitudinal study.So that really helps.
这是一个纵向研究 这种方法真的很有用

927
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,820
It also helps deal with non major depression.
还能改善中度以下的的抑郁症

928
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,650
It helps dealing with sadness.

929
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,540
Now how does it work? How does it work?
这种方法是怎么起作用的?

930
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,920
Let me very briefly- again I do recommend this book;

we can have a whole course on this book.
光用这本书就可以开一门课程

934
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,230
and acceptance of the body signal.
并接受身体信号

935

What do they mean here?
这是什么意思?

936
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,100
You see,whenever we enter experiencing emotion,

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,640
Positive emotions such as happiness- it could be butterflies or
例如像快乐这样的积极情绪 可能会忐忑

939
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,860
you know just feeling very broad in the upper body whatever it is

if I experience,personal when I experience anxiety,it's here.
我个人来说 当我感到焦虑时 这里

951
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,800
is that when we begin to experience a painful emotion,
当我们开始感受到痛苦情绪时

952
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,640
immediately going and becoming mindful,
我们马上就要开始运用意念

953
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,780
aware of where the physical manifestation is.
开始找出这个身体反应在哪里

954
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,710
So instead of beginning to ruminate
而不要钻角头尖

955
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,270
and to dwell on "why am I depressed","what's going on",
"为什么我会抑郁""怎么回事"

956
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,130
"what's happening","not again","I hope this won't start..."
"发生什么事了""又犯了""千万别又犯了"

957
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,330
Instead of going in to this rumination,
我们不要马上想到这些

958
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,550
going immediately to the physical manifestation of it,
而是马上找出这个情绪的身体反应

959
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,950
to the body.
想到身体

960
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,190
So I'm beginning to feel stressed.OK.
我开始感到有压力 好的

961
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,230
And focusing on it and accepting that knot.
把注意力集中到这里 接受这个结

962
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,920
Not trying to fix it as we'll talk about in a minute.
不要尝试去消除它 这点我们稍后会谈

963
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,810
Simply accepting it for what it is,looking at it and saying,
只需接受它的存在 看着它想

964
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:58,930
"oh.That's interesting.Oh it's quite a big knot.
"真有趣 很大的一个结"

965
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,470
Oh no it's small.Oh it's getting actually bigger."

966
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,660
As opposed to saying

967
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,100
"I want it to go away.Oh it is going away.That's interesting."
"我想它消失 它消失了 真有趣"

968
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,830
But that's not the purpose.
这不是这一步的目的

969
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,180
The purpose is simply to become aware of it,
这一步的目的只需察觉到它的存在

970
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,310
simply to become aware of
只需察觉到

971
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,020
whatever the physical manifestation of the emotion is.
这种情绪引起的身体反应

972
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,430
Now why does it work?
为什么这样能行得通?

973
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,270
It works because it creates an alternative neural pathway.
它能行得通是因为它形成了一条新的神经通路

974
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,810
With a usual pathway that it's created,when we feel dis-easy,
在原来的神经通路下 当我们感到不适时

975
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,340
it's going into the mind,ruminating about it
脑袋就会发现不适 苦苦思索它

976
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,740
and usually going to the channel that existed before.
通常就会走回原有的通路里

977
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,580
The channels or channels that existed before,
这些原来的通路

978
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,430
and these channels are associated with our depression
是和我们的抑郁相连的

979
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,370
or previous negative experiences that have been reinforced.
和我们之前的消极情绪相连 并且得到增强

980
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,350
What we are doing now,
我们现在要做的

981
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,370
instead of going into these enforced channels inside our mind
不是走回我们脑袋里这些增强了的通路上

982
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,240
and further reinforcing them,
并且再一次增强它们

983
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,060
we are creating an alternative one- oh pain?!
而是形成一条新的通路 痛了?

984
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,140
Let's go to the body.
我们进入身体

985
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,980
And that alternative channel-
那条新通路

986
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,000
the reason why it works because that's when we are drawing,
这个方法管用是因为当我们形成新通路时

987
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:10,640
that's when we are going to the body's natural ability to heal.
它通往我们身体的自然治愈能力

988
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,400
Most of the illnesses that we face,
我们患上的大部分疾病

989
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:19,080
the body has- most not all- has the compacity to heal itself.
不是全部 但大部分病身体都能自行治愈

990
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,400
Most of the cuts that you get-
大部分切伤的伤口

991
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,480
you don't need to do anything about it.
你不用管它

992
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,020
In fact,you shouldn't do anything about small cuts.
事实上 你不应该处理小伤口

993
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,020
You know play with it.Look at it.Touch it.
你不用弄它 看它 摸它

994
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,620
Just let nature take its course.
让自然的力量来治愈它

995
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:33,460
It will fix it by itself.Same with digestion.
它会自己愈合的 消化也一样

996
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,930
You don't need to think about digest...
你不用想着消化

997
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,330
The body has its own internal wisdom,its own internal healer.
身体有自己的内在智慧 内在医生

998
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,860
And this is exactly what happens
同样道理

999
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,200
when you go and you divert attention from
当你不再集中注意力想

1000
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,850
"oh what I'm gonna do about it; What's happening;
"我该怎么消除它 怎么回事

1001

and why I'm feeling this way; what's the cause."

Somtimes it's important to do it and to analyze it,

1005
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,740
to write about it,as opposed to to ruminate about it,

1007
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,370

1008
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,220
in most situations is just to go to the body,bodily sensation.
在大部分情况下 就是马上想到身体的感觉

1009
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,500
And be aware of it.Accept it.Don't try to fix it.

And the,our internal healer will take care of itself.

just like everything else that we've discussed in this class.

How do we practice it?

1018
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,590
First- and this is part of their 8 week program,
首先 这是书中的八周疗法中的一部分

1019
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,890
which is what I'm doing right now- the first is body scan.
我现在也在练 首先是身体扫描

And this is doing it in a cold state.

00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,300
This is doing it in the practice,in a simulator.
在模拟状态下的练习

1030
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,100
Then when we are in a hot state,

when we actually experience that emotion,that painful emotion,

1033
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,280
Practice also means when we lose focus,we go back to it.

00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,470
The practice is not remaining completely centered for 30 minutes.

1036
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,680
The practice is losing and coming back.
练习时 精神分散了 再集中

1037
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,170
Losing focus and coming back again.

1038
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,350
And then,also practicing in the real life.
然后在现实生活中也要练习

1039
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,390
So whenever I feel stressed,merely going"OK.

1040
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,330
So what's the physical manifestation of it?"

we are talking about the body.
谈了身体

1043
00:59:52,920 --> 01:00:00,120
You can also practice by using cognitive reconstruction.
你们也可以用认知重建来练习

1044
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,910
How? For instance.
怎样练习?举个例子

1045
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,160
Let's say I'm thinking about a talk that I have to give tonight.
例如我想到今晚我要做的一个讲座

1046
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,790
And I'm very nervous for it.
我感到很紧张

1047
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,670
Large audience.Important audience.
很多观众 重要的观众

1048
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:16,090
And every time I think of it,my initial inclination is stress.
每次想到这 我第一个反应就是紧张

1049
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,840
And I get this adrenalin feel here and I don't feel good about it
我感受到这里的肾上腺素 很难受

1050
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,620
Or the knot in my stomach.
感到我胃打了一个结

1051
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,100
So how do I deal with it? Each time I think about it,I say,
我怎么办?每次想到这讲座 我就会想

1052
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,380
"OK.Where am I feeling it in the body?"
"好的 这个身体反应在哪里?"

1053
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,600
Another way of dealing with it is cognitively reconstructing it,
另一个方法就是用认知重建它

1054
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,350
saying instead of stress,what a privilege.
不要觉得它是压力 觉得它是荣幸

1055
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:38,390
Remember I told you that
我刚才说过

1056
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,020
I had a very large client that I had to speak to,
我要跟一个很大的客户谈

1057

I was very stressed about that talk.

1058
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,340
And every time my mind went to stress,

1059
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,130
within half a second I said,"no,it's a privilege.
马上我跟自己说"不 这是荣幸

1060
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,820
It's so wonderful that I have the opportunity to do it."
我能有这样的机会做讲座真是太棒了"

1061
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,700
Again,this is different from avoiding.
重申 这不同于逃避

1062
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,760
This is different from repressing.
不同于抑制

1063
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,270
There is a time to simply accept
有时候只需要接受它

1064
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,650
and to give ourselves the permission to be human.
明白这是人之常情

1065
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:09,220
However it's useless to just constantly ruminate about it
但是 苦苦思索这种情绪上是没用的

1066
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,290
and simply strengthen the neural pathways.
只会加强这条神经通路

1067
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,650
So this reaction of either going to the physical body
这种反应 或者专注于身体

1068
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:19,510
or sometimes going to the cognitive reconstruction
或者专注于认知重建

1069
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,280
can be very useful.
都很有用

1070
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,750
Remember when we want change,
记得 当我们想改变时

1071
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,300
we want to draw as much as possible on A,B and C-

1072
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,210
on affect,on behavior,and cognition.

1073
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,720
And these are just two very helpful techniques.

1074
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,050
I use it constantly,whether it's going in the body

Again the data shows how helpful it is.
有数据证明它多有用

01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:58,410
Let's try it.Let's do a quick mindfulness meditation

going to the physical manifestation.
