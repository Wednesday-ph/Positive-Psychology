1
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,890
I ended last time by
在上节课结束之前

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,210
sharing some biographical details about my life.
我跟大家分享了我生平的一些事

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,970
Some people asked me after,"are they really true?"
后来有人问我"是真的吗?"

4
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,150
So yes,they are absolutely true.
没错 是千真万确的

5
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:42,970
And I told the incident from two different perspectives―
这个故事我是从两个不同的角度来讲的

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,920
first as a fault finder,and then as a merit finder.
第一个是消极者的 第二个是积极者的

7
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,350
Now the important thing to keep in mind
大家要记住的很重要的一点是

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,710
when we think about the merit finder is that it's not that
我们所说的积极者并非

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,090
the merit finder does not experience pain or disappointment,
不会感到痛苦或失望

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:07,440
or anger,or humility,or fear,or disappointment.
愤怒或羞辱 恐惧或失望

11
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,310
It's very disappointing to say the least,
至少无法追求自己的目标

12
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,030
not to be able to pursue one's goal,
是一件很让人失望的事

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,930
if the goal happens to be a professional career in squash.
如果这个目标碰巧是关于职业生涯的

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,780
It is very humiliating to be the only person

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,010
who fails of a program and to have to walk around

for a whole year in William James while

17
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,760
feeling like you have a horn coming out of head.
就像脑袋长了一个角那么羞愧

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,060
It's not fun. It's painful.
这种事没有快乐可言 非常痛苦

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,620
However,the difference between a merit finder,sorry,
但是积极者...对不起

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,680
a benefit finder and a fault finder is that,
积极者和消极者的区别在于

21
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,010
the benefit finder understands that
积极者明白

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,830
while things don't necessarily happen for the best,
这世界是不会事事如愿的

23
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,850
it is possible to make the best of things that happen.
但我们可以扭转坏事

24
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,180
Things will be OK. Things will turn out fine.
事情会好转的 一切会变顺利的

25
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,870
It may take a while.
可能需要点时间

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Until I see the benefit of it,it may take a while and I will

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,180
get over the humiliation or the pain or the disappointment.
可能要过一段时间才能忘了羞辱痛苦失望

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,190
But that,too,shall pass.
但一切不好的事都会过去

29
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,980
In other words,The benefit finder understands that
也就是说 积极者明白

30
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,450
these feelings are temporary,gives him or herself the permission
这些感觉是暂时的 他会允许自己

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,000
to be human and then understands

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,290

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,800

Because perfectionism is real intense for your failure

39
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,840
or we feel it's all or nothing.

Either we have a complete flawless record,or it's useless.
如果你不是完美无瑕 那你就是一无是处

41
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,930
It's either phenomenal,or catastrophe. All or nothing.

was that it can also be used as an intervention.

这些即将开始传教的修女受到方方面面的测试

144
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,830
One of the things they did was write biographical sketches
其中一个就是她们要写自己的短小传记

145
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,360
of themselves. And we had this data for decades.
这个资料几十年前就收集起来了

146
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,430
And psychologists just very recently opened up the data
最近心理学家才打开这些资料

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,570
and wanted to look at it,
想对它进行研究

148
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,250
wanted to understand what predicts longevity.
想弄明白

149
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,100
Which of the nuns are still alive today? How long did they live?
有几个修女活到了今天?活了多久?

150
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,210
OK,this was done in 1932 when they were avergae age of 22.
这个实验在1932年展开 她们当时22岁

151
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,380
And they looked for predictors of longevity
他们想找长寿的预测因素

152
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,210
so they looked at how complex their essays were-
所以他们看她们的传记写得多深奥

153
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,730
in other words,their intellectual capacities,
也就是说考察她们的智力水平

154
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,020
zero correlation to longevity; they looked at place of residence-
跟长寿一点关系都没有 他们看居住环境

155
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
maybe they lived in places with less or more pollution
看看居住环境的污染程度

156
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,670
that would impact how long they lived,
会不会影响她们的寿命

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,290
zero correlation- California,Boston,no difference;
没联系 住加州的和住波士顿的没分别

158
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,860
they looked at how devout they were,their levels of belief
他们研究她们的虔诚程度 信仰程度

159
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,530
at that time at the age of 22- didn't predict longevity.
她们那时才22岁 对长寿没什么影响

160
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,990
There was one thing and one thing alone
只有一样东西

161
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,720
that predicted how long they would live.
跟她们的寿命有联系

162
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,660
And that was positive feelings.
那就是积极情绪

163
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,780
What they did,the researchers,
研究人员所做的是

164
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,160
was looking at the biographical sketches-
看她们写的传记

165
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,360
now they had no idea who these women were,
他们不认识这些女人

166
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,990
so it was a completely blind study-
所以这是一个完全盲法研究

167
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,750
double blind. And they looked,
双盲研究 研究人员看这些传记

168
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,780
they categorized the writings into four categories:
把传记分为四类

169
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,360
the most positive,the least positive
最积极的 最不积极的

170
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,590
and two categories in between.
中间还有两类

171
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,150
And then they compared the most positive quartile
然后他们比较最积极那类

172
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,230
to the least positive quartile.
和最不积极的那类

173
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,860
And here are the results that they found.
他们得出以下的结果

174
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,030
Let me give you a sample though before so that
我先给大家读一段她们写的传记

175
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,290
you get a sense of what a positive sample is
让你们了解积极的传记是怎样的

176
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,660
and what a less positive sample is.
最不积极的是怎么样的

177
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,530
So here is Cecilia O'Payne from the positive quartile:
这一段是积极类里的Cecilia O'Payne写的

178
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,310
"God started my life off well by bestowing upon me
"上帝为我的人生开了一个好头"

179
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,550
grace of inestimable value. The past year which I spent
他恩赐我生命以无尽的价值 过去一年"

180
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,570
as a candidate studying at Notre Dame has been a very happy one.
"我在圣母学院受训 这一年我过得很快乐"

181
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,450
Now I look forward with eager joy to receiving the Holy Habit

Happy. Joy. Love. This is a positive person.
快乐 欢乐 爱 这是一个积极的人

184
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,630
Now here is someone from the least positive quartile.
下面这位属于最不积极的一类

185
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,650
As you'll see,this is not someone who is particularly negative,
你们会看到 她并不是特别消极

186
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,300
but not a person who focuses on positive,on joy,on happiness.
但她并不关注于积极情绪上 没有欢乐

187
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,910
Marguerite Donnelly: "I was born on September 26,1909,
Marguerite Donnelly"我出生于1909年9月26日"

188
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,070
the eldest of seven children,five girls and two boys.
"家里最大的孩子 五个女孩 两个男孩"

189
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,960

190
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,480
teaching chemistry and second year Latin at Notre Dame Institute.

"蒙主恩赐 我会尽力完成使命"

192
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,960
for the spread of religion and for my personal sanctification."
"传教 修道"

193
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,340
Again,very factual.
非常写实

194
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,560
But not as positive as much of a merit finder,
没有积极者的那么积极

195
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,990
an optimist as Cecilia O'Payne.
没有Cecilia O'Payne那么乐观

196
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,740
Let's look at some of the data now.
现在我们来看看这些资料

197
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,360
At the age of 85,at the age of 85―and again,
85岁时 我要重申 她们85岁

198
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,650
this is a looking back,90% of the most cheerful quartile were
是很多年前的事了 最积极那类有90%

199
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,350
alive and just 34% of the least cheerful quartile were alive.
还活着 而最不积极那类只有34%

200
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,350
This is significant difference.
两个数据相差很大

201
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,330
Now that dosen't mean that there aren't some fault finders
这并不说明消极者就不会

202
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,830
who lived to 120 and merit finders
活到120岁 也不能说明积极者就不会

203
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,930
who died of a heart attack at 30. Of course,there are.
30岁死于心脏病发 当然个别例外是有的

204
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,250
But on average,
但平均来说

205
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,320
the best predictor what accounts for the most of the variance,
在这个长寿研究中 最能解释

206
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,590
in terms of longevity in the study,
两组相差如此大的数据的因素

207
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,260
was positive feelings- positivity in general.
就是积极情绪 总体的积极性

208
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,730
Here is 9 years later. Same study. At the age of 94,
再过九年 她们94岁的时候

209
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,830
54% of the most cheerful quartile were still alive
最积极一类中有54%还活着

210
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,820
while just 11% of the least cheerful quartile were alive.
而最不积极那类只有11%

211
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,510
These are remarkable results. Again,you have some sketches.
结果很显著 你也可以拿一些传记来

212
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,570
You analyze them,not knowing who lived and who died.
分析它们 你不知道谁还活着 谁死了

213
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,210
And just based on the single factor- positivity,
只根据积极心态这一因素

214
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,990
you are able to predict with remarkable significant levels.
你的预测就能达到很准确的程度

215
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,710
You are able to predict longevity-
你能预测谁会长寿

216
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,730
who will be alive and who will not be.
谁还活着 谁已经去世了

217
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,830
Now when I look at this data-
现在我看这些资料

218
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,170
and there's a lot more data on longevity,on health,
还有很多关于长寿 身体

219
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,870
on well-being,I said to myself,"Wow. So this is fantastic!
健康等资料 我觉得"太棒了"

220
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,650
Benefit finding really works! Being an optimistic is good!"
"积极心态真的很有用 当乐观主义者真好"

221
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,780
And I have two questions then,"Why isn't everyone optimistic?"
但我有两个问题 "为什么不是每个人都是乐观主义者?"

222
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,280
If we become happier,if we become healthier,
如果我们能更幸福更健康

223
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,220
why not,why aren't we all optimistic? That's the first question.
为什么我们不都去做乐观主义者?这是第一个问题

224
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,070
The second question is: alright,so I want to be more optimistic.
第二个问题是 如果我想当乐观主义者

225
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,160
How do I become that?
我该怎么做?

226
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,120
So first one: why aren't more people optimistic?
第一个问题:为什么不是人人都是乐观主义者?

227
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,080
Second: how do I become opticmistic?
第二个:怎么变成乐观主义者?

228
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,680
I am going to answer these two questions.
我会回答这两个问题

229
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,760
Let me begin with the first.
先来看第一个问题

230
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,190
One of the main reasons why there aren't more people
为什么乐观主义者这么少的主要原因是

231
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:27,710
who are optimistic is that optimists are considered detached.
我们认为乐观主义是不切实际

232
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,890
And how do we know that?
我们怎么知道?

233
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,280
Well,or what leads to the sense of detachment,
谁让我们觉得这是不切实际

234
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,440
to the notion that optimists are detached? It's mostly the media.
谁让我们觉得乐观主义者不切实际?最主要是媒体

235
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,100
Because what do we see? We mostly see hatred.
我们在媒体上都看到什么?仇恨

236
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,040
We mostly see blood shed. We mostly see unhappiness.
流血 不幸福

237
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,830
We see terrorism. And then,when someone says
恐怖主义 如果有人说

238
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,840
"well I'm optimistic; I think the world is a good place",
"我是乐观主义者 我觉得世界很美好"

239
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,890
that person- what? Are you out of your mind?
什么?你脑子不正常了吗?

240
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,180
You are detached Pollyanna.
你不切实际 你盲目乐观

241
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,160
Just look at all the terrible things in the world.
你看看这世界发生的可怕事情

242
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,610
How can you be in such a world- how can you be optimistic?
在这样一个世界里 你怎么乐观?

243
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,520
How can you be positive?
你怎么积极?

244
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,830
How can you talk about joy and happiness?
快乐幸福从哪谈起?

245
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,680
And positive psychology in a world like this?
在这样的一个世界里谈幸福心理学?

246
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,350
You must be Pollyannish.
你太盲目乐观了

247
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,650
In many ways,the message of Thomas Hobbes is correct:
很大程度上来说 Thomas Hobbes的话说得没错

248
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,580
you know,life is short,brutish,nasty and poor.
人生短暂 残酷 可悲

249
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,000
And that seems much more likely to be true
在现代世界 这种悲观情绪

250
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,030
than an optimistic sense of life.
比乐观情绪更切合实际

251
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,670
Let's look at some of the headlines.
我们来看看几个新闻头条

252

And you know again,Turkey. Protest ambassies. EU.

billions of mothers who embrace their children.

270
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,030

而是关注想脱身的母亲 他们报道原因

271
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,640
what led the mother to want out of this relationship.
是什么让这位母亲想抽身离开

272
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,350
And so on and so on. So much negative.

273
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,630
How can we be positive in a world like this?
在这样一个世界里 我们怎么乐观?

274
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,430
It would be really unrealistic of us,wouldn't it?
那太不切实际了吧?

275
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,820
Well,I want to show you an excerpt now

It actually makes us into pessimists,

are pessimistic when the media has such an impact on us?
是悲观主义者? 当媒体对我们有那么大影响力时

355
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,710
Again,not to belittle the role of the media.
我这样说不是贬低媒体的作用

356
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,880
But what I am doing is highlighting certain aspect

We saw it when it came to Marva Collins who said
当Marva Collins说以下这句话时

421
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,440
"let's focus on the seed of greatness in these individuals".
"我们要关注人性中伟大的种子"

422
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,530
We saw it with the research on resilience
我们在恢复性研究里看过

423
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,430
when the focus was on "why are so many failing" versus
当关注点从"为什么这么多人失败了"

424
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,170
"what make some individuals succeed"
转变为"为什么情况这么困难,但有些人能成功"

425
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,160
despite the unfavorable circumstances.
我们就能明白这个道理

426
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,770
Focus creates reality. Also,think about it.
关注创造现实 大家想想

427
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,940
I mean when we read about frauds
当我们看到诈骗罪时

428
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,970
and dishonesty in newspaper constantly,what we begin to believe-
看到报纸上经常报道的不正当行为时 我们开始相信

429
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,060
what we naturally begin to believe is
我们开始相信

430
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,060
"well,you want to be successful?

431

You want to become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company,

432
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,220
like Enron? You have to engage in fraud.
像安然那样的公司?那你就要犯诈骗罪

433
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,920
There is no real other way to succeed. Why?
除此以外,没有别的成功道路了 为什么?

434
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,250
Because the millions of other people
因为另外那几百万个

435
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,790
who are succeeding honestly are not reported on,
靠正当途径成功的人 没有被报道

436
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,230
are mostly not reported on. And that's what we focus on.
大部分都没有被报道 我们关注的是负面

437
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,820
Not to say it's not important to have whistle blower
我并非说揭发者存在并不重要

438
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,860
and to talk about these things. It's equally important though
报道负面新闻并不重要 但同样重要的是

439
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,620
to also focus on those who do it honestly and well,
我们还要关注那些正直而且成功的人

440
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,750
because there are vast majority,way over 90%.
因为他们才是大多数 超过90%

441
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Because if we don't,then the person will think "well,
因为如果不这样做 那些人就会想

442
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,570
if I want to succeed in business,
"如果我想成为成功的商人"

443
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,670
then you know I have to bend the rules".
"那我就要做违规的事"

444
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,640
And when an ethical decision comes up,
当他们要作出道德决定时

445
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,400
when he or she becomes the manager at the age of 35,they say
当他们在35岁当上经理时 他们就会想

"well,the only way to succeed is I bend the rules slightly".
"成功的唯一途径就是不要太守规矩

447
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,940
And that creates self-fulfilling prophecy.
这就形成了自我实现预言

448
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,780
Or,how many people here- seriously show of hands-
这里有多少人...说真的 请大家举手

449
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,450
once thought of going into politics,becoming governor,

or President,or Prime Minister?

OK,quite a lot. I mean,we know that,

how many people were told by others

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,350
"you shouldn't go into politics- you are too honest"?
"你不要进入政界 你太诚实了"?

457
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,790
Too honest. You know,we hear it all the time.
太老实 我们经常听到这样的话

458
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,780
And that becomes self-fulfilling prophecy,
这就成了自我实现预言

459
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:34,680
because many honest people who could potentially make the world
因为很多本来会从政改善世界的诚实人

460
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,820
a better place by going into politics don't go in.
有了这种想法后就不从政了

461
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,900
Because "politicians are crooks".
因为别人都说"政客是骗子"

462
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,250
Well,politicians are not crooks. Yes,there are politicians

463
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,170
who are crooks,but they are the minority.
是骗子 但他们只占少数

464
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,220

00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,640
want to make the world a better place.
想让世界变得更美好的

467
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,150
but with good intentions,within ethical code.
但他们的意图是好的 他们有道德操守

468
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,630
You know it's a wonder that there is so much good in our world,
虽然我们都关注坏事 但世界上还是有很多好事

469
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,540
while the focus is so much on the bad.

470
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,560
It really is a wonder to me.
在我来看 真的是一个奇迹

471
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,670
It just shows how powerful human nature,

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,190
and how powerful the good part of our nature is,
我们人性的善良因子的强大

473
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,200
because we can sustain goodness.
因为我们能保持这份善良

474
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:29,740
Also,how about this?- The constant chattering in our mind is
还有 我们脑袋里不停有个声音在说

475
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,330
"why didn't I do this? Why haven't I done the reading yet?

Why haven't I completed my paper?

477
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,790
Why did I say that to that person?
"为什么我要跟他说这种话?"

478
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,680
Why did she said that back to me?" Mostly,negative chatter.
"为什么她要跟我说这种话?"大部份都是消极的

479
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,030
How often do we have the chatter

480
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,650
"well you know I have a really lovely conversation today"?
"我今天跟别人聊得很开心?"

481
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,090
Or "you know,I just finish so much work- I was productive.
"我刚做完这么多工作 我太高效了"

482
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,930
I did so well." "Wow,I just got an A-

483
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,420
and I didn't even work that hard for it."
"我都没怎么花精力"

484
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,570
I mean,of course,not here,but seen other places.
当然 在这门课是不可能的 在别的课程上

485
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,300
Why don't we have these kind of chattering in our mind?
为什么我们脑袋里很少这种积极的声音?

486
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,620
Again,because our schema focuses on negative.
因为我们的观念都关注在消极上

487
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,030
We are going to talk about change next week

488
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,630
and we'll understand there are actual neural pathways
我们会明白媒体在我们脑袋里

489
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,440
that have been created by media,
形成了一条神经通道

490
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,810
by the focus on what is not working. Having created it
因为它让我们关注于消极问题上

491
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,130
so we gravitate toward becoming fault finders.
所以我们慢慢就变成了消极者

492
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,590
How we change that? We'll talk about that in a minute.
怎么改变?我们等一下再谈这个问题

493
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,570
It's important to focus on the good.
关注于好事上是很重要的

494
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,020
You know what they say about Ghandi?

495
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,120
That the most important thing that he did

do you make America proud of itself?
你们让美国为自己感到自豪吗?

501
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,790
Because you know America has faults. It is not a perfect country.
你们知道美国也有缺点 不是一个完美国度

502
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,610
It has made mistakes from 1776 and will continue to
它从建国起就在犯错 以后还会继续犯

503
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,730
make mistakes for,hopefully for many years to come.

But still,I would argue,the greatest country in the world.

505
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,260
So many people want to come here,want to live here. Why?

506
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,370
Because of the freedom. Because of the opportunities.

507
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,840
Again,not perfect,but a great country.
虽然不完美 但这是一个伟大的国度

508
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,600
Do we appreciate America? Do we appreciate its greatness?
我们感激美国吗?我们感激它的伟大之处吗?

509
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,750
Because if we don't,we can pay a high price.
因为如果我们不感激 我们会付出很大的代价

510
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:32,080
It's in vogue now "US bashing" in this country. In this place.
现在国内很流行"抨击美国"

511
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,410
And the problem is when we just focus on bashing,
当我们专注于抨击时

512
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,230
when we just focus on the negative,
当我们专注于消极时

513
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,530
we create a worse reality rather than improving the reality.
我们没有改善现实 反而使其恶化

514
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,690
So yes,we need to be critical.
没错 我们需要有批判精神

515
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,100
And one of the virtues of this great country is that
这个国家的伟大之处之一就是

516
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,430
you can stand out in the street or write in articles
你可以站在大街上 或者写一篇文章

517
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,290
and critize the politicians,the system,other people.
批评政客 制度 其他人

518
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,130
It's one of the great contributions of this country: free speech.
这就是这个国家对世界的重大贡献之一:言论自由

519
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,530
But at the same time,we also have the freedom

520
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,110
and we should exercise the freedom to focus on

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,100
what is working on the good.
社会中的好现象

522
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:14,900
Because appreciating is important,whether it's a country,
因为感激很重要 不管是感激一个国家

523
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,920
whether it's a relationship,whether it's individual,

524
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,810
whether it's students,whether it's teachers.
一个学生还是一个老师

525
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,050
Appreciation is important.
感激很重要

526
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,020
The meaning of "appreciate" from dictionary: valuing;
我从字典查来"appreciate"的意思:重视其价值

527
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,290
the act of recognizing the best in people or the world around us;
认同我们身边的人或世界中最好的一面

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,580
affirming past and present strengths and potentials;
肯定过去和现在的优点和潜力

529
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,190
to perceive those things that
感激那些为生物

530
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,590
give life (health,vitality,excellence) to living systems.
赐予生命 健康 活力和优点的事物

531
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,400
So the first meaning of appreciate is to say thank you.
appreciate的第一个意思就是感激

532
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,190
That's a nice thing to do,
这是一种好行为

533
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,270
but it's much more than just a nice thing to do.
但它不只是一种好行为

534
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,020
We talked about this before.
我们以前谈过这点

535
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,620
The second meaning of appreciate is increasing value:
"appreciate"第二个意思是增值

536
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,910
the economy appreciates; money in the bank appreciates.
经济增值 银行里的钱增值

537
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,630
And that's an important meaning,
这个意思很重要

538
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,290
because when we appreciate the good,the good appreciates.
因为当我们感激好事时 好事增值

539
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,720
When we appreciate the good in our lives,
当我们感激生活中的好事时

540
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,600
when we appreciate the good in other people,

541
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,330
when you appreciate the good in our country,
当你感激这个国家的伟大之处时

542
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,150
we get more of it. Unfortunately,the opposite is also the case.
好事就会增多 可惜反之亦然

543
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,120
When we don't appreciate something,whether it's ourselves,
当我们不懂欣赏时 不管是我们自己

544
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,390
whether it's our country,whether it's our relationship,
我们国家 还是我们的恋情

545
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,000
the good depreciates. Remember I talked about it in the past.
好事就会贬值 这点我以前就讲过了

546
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,000
Is it any wonder so many relationships flounder,
有没想过为什么很多恋情不顺利

547
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,450
fail after the honeymoon phase?
蜜月期过后就撑不下去

548
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,260
If the main question becomes "what's wrong?"
人们都会问"出什么问题了?"

549
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,710
or "How can we improve the relationship?"
或者"我们怎么能改善这段关系?"

550
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,560
and if we just ask this question,
如果我们单纯问这些问题

551
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,810
our focus becomes on what is not working,on the weaknesses.
我们就会专注于问题和弱点上

552
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,900
And we ignore the virtues,the strength,
我们就会无视优点

553
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,700
the things that worked and are working.
顺利的地方

554
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,450
And when we don't focus on these things,they depreciate.
当我们不专注于优点上 优点就会贬值

555
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,780
As far as we are concerned,they don't exist,
在我们眼里甚至看不到这些优点的存在

556
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,310
just like the children on the bus that not exist for you
就像在你眼里 公车上那个小孩

557
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,350
as far as you were concerned.
是不存在的一样

558
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,480
What appreciating does is in essence create a growth spiral.
本质上 感激能形成一个良性循环

559
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,430
Let me expand. Let me just give you a random example.
我来解释一下 我来随便举一个例子

560
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,500
Let's say,Monday morning,or Tuesday morning,

you are walking toward 1504.

562
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,230
And suddenly you see a friend of yours.

565
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,210
and says,"Wow. You look fantastic!"

566
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,500
Now,how do you feel at that point? You feel fantastic.

567
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,650
And you know you walk a little bit more pride,

568
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,250
more proud and you walk into the classroom just here.

569
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:44,240
And another friend sees you and says,"Wow! You look fantastic!"
另一个朋友看到你说"你看起来真精神"

570
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,440
And how do you feel at this point? Well,fantastic-er!
这时你会有什么感觉?更精神了

571
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,120
And then you come in. You sit down here.
然后你进来 坐下

00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,060
And another friend who you haven't seen for a month sees you,

574
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,390
Fantastic-ist! And so on and so on and so on-
你精神到不能再精神了,往复循环

575
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,260
made you day in an upward spiral.
你这天就会越过越好

576
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,130
Now think about a slightly different scenario.
现在假设是另一种情境

577
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,580
You walk in 1504 on Thursday morning.

And suddenly a friend of yours whom you trust

579
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:20,020
and value sees you and says,"oh my God,what's wrong?"
看到你跟你说"天啊 你怎么了?"

580
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,590
Now there may have been nothing wrong before;

581
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,490
there is a lot wrong now. And you walk in the door,
但现在有事了 你走进教室

582
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,500
and someone sees you and says,"oh my Lord."
有人看到你说"天啊"

583
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,800
And how do you feel? You feel even worse.

584
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,610
And you sit down and you see someone else who looks at you,

585
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,230
just completely shocked.
完全震惊了

586
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,960
And you are feeling worse-r and worse-ist.
这时你的感觉跌到谷底了

587
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,640
And so on and so on and so on in a downward spiral.
恶性循环 越来越糟

588
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,650
Appreciation creates upward spiral.
感激能形成良性循环

589
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,150
And we know,sometimes,one sentence,one word at the beginning
我们知道有时候 一日之始听到的

590
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,260
of the day- and you have a wonderful day,or week.

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,130
This research showing how a single sentence very often

592
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,680
can impact an entire life. This is work done by Bandura.

593
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,930
Single sentence of appreciation can give us strength to go on.
一句感激之言就能让我们有力量支撑下去

594
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
Now the key here: it has to be genuine appreciation.
但这有一个关键:感激一定要出自真心诚意

595
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,490
One of the things we'll talk about when we discuss self-esteem
等我们谈到自尊时 我们会谈到

596
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,770
is how destructive and harmful ingenuine appreciation is.
虚假的感激会带来多大的伤害

597
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,040
And now I am not talking about your boyfriend or girlfriend
我不是说你们的男朋友或女朋友

598
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,100
ask you "so how do I look" having just come out,
穿着同一身衣服出去玩了一晚

599
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,600
come back from a day and worn something the whole night.

600
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,230
You are not going to tell them "well,actually awful".
你当然不能说"很难看"

601
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,980
So OK. We are not talking about these grey areas.
我们说的不是这种灰色地带

602
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,260
But it has to be real. It has to be connected to reality.
感激一定要真诚 要跟实际相关

603
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,250
We'll talk about that much more when we talk about self-esteem.
等我们讲到自尊时再深入谈这点

604
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,950
The key though is that you need to understand
但关键是你要明白

605
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,320
there is always something real to appreciate.
你总能找到可以感激的东西

606
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:09,860
Think about the study with the cancer patients,or AIDS patients.
想想刚才的癌症病人研究 或者艾滋病人研究

607
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,030
Even they were able to find something good in a very difficult,
连他们都能在这么悲惨的境况中

608
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,800
tragic scenario,situation. And when they appreciate the good,

609
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,780
when they find benefit in that situation,the good appreciates.
当他们从坏事中看到好事时 好事就会升值

610
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,860
It grows. Oprah,a real benefit finder:
越变越好 Oprah是真正的积极者

611
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,430
"What you focus on expands,and when you focus on the goodness
"你专注的东西会变大 当你专注于生活中的好事上"

612
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,150
in your life,you create more of it.
"你就能创造出更多好事"

613
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,520
Opportunities,relationships,even money flowed my way

614
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,250
when I learned to be grateful

615
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,790
no matter what happened in my life."
"不管我生活中发生了什么事"

616
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,420
Because what we focus on appreciates.
因为我们专注的东西会升值

617
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,640
Again,the metaphore that I have been talking about
再次说明 我一直在课堂上

618
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,340
throughout the course: the seed-
用这个比喻:种子

619
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,210
what happens to a seed if we don't water it?
如果我们不给它浇水 它会怎样?

620
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,060
If we don't shed a light on it?
如果我们不让阳光照射它 它会怎么样?

621
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,250
What happens to that seed is that it withers and dies.
这种子就会凋萎死去

622
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,620
And that,unfortunately,is the fate of most human potential.
很可惜 人类的大部分潜力就是这样被扼杀的

623
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,880
Most relationship potential. Most countries.
大部份恋情和国家的潜力

624
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,260
And if we want it to grow,want it to blossom,
如果我们想它成长 想它开花

625
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,080
we have to shed a light on it. We have to water it.
我们就要让阳光照射它 给它浇水

626
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,120
This is exactly what Marva Collins did with the seed of greatness
Marva Collins正是这样对待她每个学生

627
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,310
that existed in every one of her students.
身上的伟大的种子

628
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,200
This is what the Pygmalion,the classic experiment showed,
在经典的皮格马利翁实验中我们看到

629
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,310
was that when teachers were made to focus on the potential

630
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,950
in those individuals who were deemed "fast spurters".

00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,920
when a light is shed on their potential,

That's when they fulfilled much more of their potential.

635
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,080
So how do we correct the false schema?

636
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,440
What do we do about it? Let me share with you something

on the societal level,something on the individual level.

638
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,180
On the societal level,create good news.
在社会层面上 我们可以创造好消息

639
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,630
Not enough of it around. Now people say it's not marketable,
现在对好消息的报道不够 有人说这好消息没市场

640
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,810
it's boring- well,OK. A lot of it is not marketable.
很无聊 没错 有很多是没市场

641
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,340
Part of it is because it is the norm,it's the usual.
部分原因是因为好事太平淡无奇了

642
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,650

Why not report much more on peace? And well-being?

646
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,960
You know a situation stops being interesting once there is peace.

It's interesting when there's a war.

Well why not focus more on these areas?

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,350
the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

662
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,510
Looking at that as well. Just to counter the negative schema.

00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,320
A light during a time when there was not much light.

I mean consider the Dark Ages. The Middle Ages.

一切从艺术开始 又如在18 19世纪 浪漫主义

on the human potential. Aristotle once said,

"fiction is more important than history."
"小说比历史更重要"

675
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,690
Because history depicts life as it is,

where the fiction depicts life as it can or ought to be.

to inspire them and helped them get through the difficult time-

689
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,610
Not ignoring what is not working. Not ignoring,but improving.
他们并非无视问题 而是在改善

690
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,500
That,by the way,is my favorite movie,Sullivan's Travels.
这是我最爱的电影《苏利文的旅行》

691
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,460
Modern art as well. Wouldn't it be lovely if we go into a gallery

692
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,880
and we feel inspired by the art- whether it's by photography,
