OK.It's a Monday.All right.

25
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:37,610
So every year when I teach the perfectionism lecture,
每年只要我一要讲完美主义的课

26
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,450
something happens.
就有点坏事要发生

27
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,840
So the first year,

I remember I actually forgot my computer at home.

So hopefully it will last the entire semester.

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,650
If not we'll just have to deal with the imperfect scenario,
如果不行的话我们就只能面对不完美了

34
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,690
but that's OK.
但是其实也没关系的

35
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,610
I think it must be something subconscious.
这肯定是潜意识里的问题

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,700
Because it's too much of a coincidence
因为这也太巧合了

37
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,070
that every time something happens.
每次都有这些事情发生

38
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,960

43
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,130
"I learned my way...I failed my way to success."

44
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,160
And we saw it with top athletes,

We see it with artist and scientist-

50
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,920

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,930

who understand the value and the importance of failure.

他们多在七十岁 八十岁甚至九十岁以上

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,350

Very important- they talked about it constantly,

whereas for the 70 80 90 year olds,
但是对于年老一代的成功人士那里

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,860
it was almost a foreign concept.

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,130
What does that even mean? Why?

Because they were at work usually 24/7.

All of them in that sample were men.

And the women were at home,taking care of the life part.

the wives were doing the life.

and both groups thought that failure as a pivotal point,

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,530
but they were able to make the best of that which happened.

throughout their lives,hardships,difficulties,
都会面临困难和阻碍

but difference between the highly successful people,

for example the sample in Warren Bennis's book

109
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,690
and many other people is that

they are able to make the best of what happens.

114
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,080
So let me move on and define what we mean by perfectionism.
我们继续来定义一下完美主义吧

115
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,280
Because there are many definitions
因为现在有很多的定义

116
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,230
and we throw that word around constantly.
我们经常提及这个词

117
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,410
But what do I actually mean by perfectionism?
但我要说的完美主义是什么

118
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,660
I define it as:
我的定义是

119
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,120
an incapacitating fear of failure that permeates our lives,
一种充斥在我们生活中的对失败的失能性恐惧

120
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,720
especially those areas that we care about most.
尤其是在我们最在意的方面

121
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,090
Note the word incapacitating.It is not just a fear of failure.
注意"失能性"这个词 不只是对失败的恐惧

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,390
OK I don't know a person who is not afraid of failure,
好吧 我也不认识哪怕一个不害怕失败

123
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,470
who is not embarrassed by it or feels frustrated by it.
也不会因为失败感到尴尬或沮丧的人

124
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,460
So that's natural.
这是很自然的

125
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,190
That's human- whether we like it or not.
这就是人性 不管我们喜欢不喜欢

126
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,920
But an incapacitating fear of failure is the failure

127
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,090
that is debilitating us,that stops us,that prevents us

128
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,560
from coping,from trying,from putting ourselves on the line.
裹足不前的的畏惧

129
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,980
And the other part that I want to highlight in this definition
而我要在这个定义里强调的另一点

130
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,310
is that "especially those areas that we care about most".
就是"尤其是我们最在意的方面"

131
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,350
You know,
你们也明白

132
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,610
I am not a perfectionist when it comes to playing Monopoly.
我在玩大富翁的时候可不是完美主义者

133
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,070
It's not that
这也不是因为...

134
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,120
It's competitive.
这的确很有竞争性

135
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,150
but it's not that important for me if I win or lose.
但是对于我来说胜败并不重要

136
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,770
But perfectionism was a central part of my life
但是完美主义确是我生活的重心

137
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,470
when it came to- as I mentioned earlier,
比如说 就如同我提到过的

138
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,370
squash which was very meaningful to me,
壁球对我而言非常重要

139
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,410
academics which is very meaningful to me,and
学术对我而言也非常重要

140
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,750
relationships which was and is a very important part of my life.
和别人的关系对我来说也非常重要

141
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,510
So in these areas,that's where I experienced perfectionism,
在这些方面 我就体会到了完美主义

142
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,250
and that's where I needed to do the work and still doing the work
也是在这些方面 我必须并且一直在努力

143
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,250
It's in those areas.Let me elaborate on this definition.
在这些方面 让我详细说明一下

144
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,740
It is an approach,a cognitive and emotional schema,
这是我们在面对人生的旅途的时候

145

that we hold toward the journey of our lives,

that the perfectionist has when he or she looks at the journey,

sometimes she may not get the grade that she expected,

169

there is no such thing as a perfect relationship

as we saw with Edison until they get to the point B.

before you get to that ideal circle that Vincent drew last time.

199
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,590
However,I also would rather not have the law of gravity

and be able to fly everywhere or float everywhere.

This is.This is a fantasy.

202
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,690
And when we have this schema in our mind,
当我们心中存在着这样的基模的时候

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,440
we are putting ourselves,fighting nature,

204
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,300
and just like we would lead an unhappy and frustrating life,

205
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,960
if we did not accept the law of gravity,
我们的生活就会充满不快与沮丧

206
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,870
we live and so many people live- so many people at Harvard,

not just at Harvard,everywhere are frustrated constantly,

because in their minds,they have this schema.

209
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,330
And again,this does not mean that we enjoy failure.

210
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,940

we have the frustration of not accepting reality.

213

Now there are consequences to having this schema.

I want to discuss some of these consequences

and some of the characteristics of a person who holds this schema

216
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,100
Now there is no perfect perfectionist.

217
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,280
As I said,we all exist somewhere along the continuum.

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,750
And there are many people,

219
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,790
again,many people here were closer to this end of the continuum.

The characteristics that I'd like to share with you are all ones

You will identify with some of the characteristics,

224
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,080
not with others.

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,240
That's fine.
这也没关系的

226

All the characteristics in addtion to being well documented in

227
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,350

In arguments,in discussions,perfectionists are defensive.
在争论和讨论中 完美主义者都有自卫性

233
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,570
Why? Because a criticism is by definition a deviation
为什么 因为批评在定义上就是一种

234
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,150
from a straight line.
对于完美的直线方式的偏离

235
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,830
It's imperfection.It's a daint.
这就是不完美 是一种挑刺

236
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,940
It's something that maybe I'm not doing perfectly well.

237
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,140
And we don't like deviations from a schema we have.
我们都不喜欢偏离我们所持基模的东西

238
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,900
Remember,the mind doesn't like when there is an inconsistency
记住了 我们的心是不喜欢内在与外在

239
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,470
between what is inside and what is outside.

We want there to be a balance,congruence.

We don't like desinence.

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,610
And if what we have in mind is the perfecionist schema,
而如果我们心中抱有的是完美主义基模

243
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,520
the criticism is a deviation from it.
而批评又是对其的偏离

244
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,630
And then we become defensive.
那我们就会变得有自卫性

245
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,270
Again,something that I experience numerously times;

something that I'm working on constantly.

In addition,or in constrast,

a person committed to excellence is open,

is welcoming of suggestions and criticisms at times.

250
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,080
It doesn't mean that he or she enjoys it,

251
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,620
but he or she understands that it's necessary,

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,490
that it's an important part of growth,of development.

253
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,020
Perfectionist focuses on the half empty part of the glass.
完美主义者只注意到空着的那半个杯子

254
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,360
Why? Because a perfectionist is obssessed by failure,
为什么 因为完美主义者为失败所困扰

255
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,780
obssessed by deviations from that straight narrow.

And whatever it is,what are obssessed with by definition
而不管是什么 困扰我们的

257
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,120
is what we constantly focus on.

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,200
So he or she constantly fosues on what is not working,

261
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,070
focuses on the half full part of the glass.
则会专注于已经满的那半个杯子

262
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,030
How? Because he or she enjoys getting to where he or she is going
为什么 因为他或她既享受达成目标

263
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,320
but also learns to enjoy every step of the way- the journey,
又学会享受过程中的每一步 那就是旅途

264
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,740
even failure is an opportunity.
即便是失败也能是机遇

265
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,500
Person com...A perfectionist over generalizes,catastrophizes.
完美主义者会过度一般化 夸大化问题

266
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,700
It's all or nothing.Either I'm perfect,or I'm a failure.
非黑即白 我要么是完美的 要么一无是处

267
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,230
And we'll see the consequences
我们等一下就能看到

268
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,500
in a minute of this "all or nothing" approach.
这样的"全部或没有"的对立于现实的方法

269
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,570
Versus realistic.

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,940
Again,realizing what reality looks like,
我们又谈到了 明白现实是什么样的

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,280
what progress in essence looks like.
明白事物的过程是怎么样的

272
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,570
For perfectionist,there is no self-acceptance.

Perfectionist- there is one way and that's the highway.
对完美主义者来说 只有一种方式是合适的

279
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,830
It is a static.

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,050
There is no improvization; there is no deviation;
没有任何提升的空间 也没有丝毫偏离

I encountered growing up- tough childhood:

very large,so inviting.So alluring.

589
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,960
But three minutes later,
但是在三分钟以后

590
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,020
I go to the fridge again,just to make sure it's still there.
我回到冰箱那看蛋糕还在不在

591
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,720
Why? Those of you who know my brother understand why.

My brother is much bigger than I am.

And it was.

had just disappeared from my eyes a few minutes.

It's not "OK,let me have a slice of it." It's nothing or all.
不会说"好吧 我就吃一块" 要么不吃要么吃完

606
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,970
And this is the schema that perfectionists have:
所以这就是完美主义者的基模

607
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,070
either I'm a supermodel or I'm overweight.

All or nothing.And it's destructive.

615
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,190
Hurts self-esteem.Why? Because...
这很伤自尊 为什么 因为

616
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,020
Nathaniel Branden who writes about self-esteem-
Nathaniel Branden写过很多关于自尊的文字

617
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,100
we'll talk a lot about him in that lecture 3 weeks from now.
我们在未来三周内将会更多地讲到他

618
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,600
The first pillar of self-esteem is self-acceptance.
自尊的第一个基础就是自我接受

619
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,800
And remember a perfectionist does not accept him/herself.
要记得完美主义者是不接受自我的

620
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,700
Second,the reason why it hurts self-esteem- remember,

621
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,940
there is constant,inevitable failure for a perfectionist
完美主义者总会遇到长期且不可避免的失败

622
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,640
because there is no perfect person.And

623
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,130
if I constantly fail or constantly perceive myself as a failure,

am I going to have high self-esteem? Of course not.
那我还会有较高的自尊心吗 当然不会

625
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,340
It also hurts self-esteem because a perfectionist

626
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,570
is less likely to try,less like to put him/herself on the line.
是他们更不愿意去尝试

627
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,250
And the price that I pay for that
而如果我不愿意尝试的话 其后果就是

628
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,130
when I don't try is lower level of self-esteem.
更加低的自尊心

629
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,200
Remember self-perception theory.
还记得自我知觉理论吗

630
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,260
Versus on-going,continuous improvement.
相对的是持续的自我提升

631
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,870
Not a straight line,but a spiral that goes up and up.
不是一条直线直上的 而是旋转向上的

632
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,680
Perfectionism harms relationships.

Again,I just look back and I,you know from this perspective,

634
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,600
it's hard for me to fathom the kind of mistakes

that I have made in relationships based on perfectionism.

636
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,260
Why? First of all,defensiveness.

637
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,880
It is very difficult to form intimacy with some one

638
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,360
when I'm constantly on the defensive,when I can't accept

639
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,380
or do something at the very least with criticisms.

What kind of intimacy is possible there?

641
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,460
The other reason why it harms relationships

642
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,800
is that very often,we mirror...

Our approach to the world mirrors our approach toward ourselves.
我们对世界的看法和对自己的看法一样

00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,380
So if I'm a perfectionist and expect perfectionism-

a straight line for myself,I would expect the same from others,

whether it's from my partner,

I think- I establish before- there is no perfect person.

654

that's not the person I thought I got together with initially.

Straight line.But it's a human being.

有人却是截然相反的

858
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,260
can stay up till 2,3,4 am in the morning,
他们可以熬夜到凌晨2点 3点 4点

859
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,790
and that's when they are the freshest.
那才是他们最有干劲的时候

860
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,730
By the way,it has to do with our internal biorhythm,
这和我们内在的生物节奏有关

861
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,530
internal circadian rhythms.
和我们的生理节奏有关

862
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,880
Because there are some people for whom-
因为有人

863
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:33,790
no one is exactly or very few people are exactly 24 hours rhythms
基本上没有人的周期是正好24小时的

864
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:37,100
We are usually either somewhere between 23 and 25.
大多数人都是23到25小时之间

865
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:41,800
So for people whose circadian rhythm is 23 hours,
对于周期是23小时的人来说

866
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,880
they get very tired at night.
他们到了晚上就会非常疲劳

867
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,530
But then they wake up very fresh in the morning.

868
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,940
Or people who are closer to 25

need that extra sleep in the morning.

00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,160
And it's for those people that I have this class at 11:30.
就是因为那些人我才将这课调到11点半

871
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,770
I know it's early but thank you for making the effort.
我知道是很早但是感谢你们的到来

872
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,190
When I got to college,most students were studying late at night.
我上大学的时候 大多数人都学到很晚

873
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,840
My roommates were studying late at night,starting at about 10
我的室友就学到很晚 从晚上10点开始

874
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,400
and going to you know midnight or 2 am in the morning.
然后学到12点甚至凌晨2点

875
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,060
And that's when they are most productive.I wasn't.
这才是他们最有效率的时候 可我不是

876
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,530
And I would get up in the morning
我宁愿早上早点起来

877
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,370
and I was tired,exhausted,couldn't really focus at night.

878
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:24,430
And when I heard about this productive hour,I changed my day.

879
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,820
And I went to sleep early.

880
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,960
So when my roommates started to study,I actually went to bed,
在我的室友开始学习的时候 我上床睡觉

881
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,710
and got up really early when my roommates were still asleep

882
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,850
and got my work done early in the morning,
然后在早上早早地把工作完成

883
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:40,120
and then went to my 11 am class after I got my work done.
做完以后去上11点的课

884
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,690
And in 3 hours in the morning,
在早上的那3个小时内

885
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,710
I got much more done- more productive,more creative,

886
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,470
much better retention than I did late at the night.
比我在晚上熬夜有效率得多了

887
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,380
These two things as I mentioned earlier

888
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,660
really changed my experience here-

getting so much more in far less time.

890
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,340
Not the perfectionist approach,the pursuing excellence approach.

891
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,750
You read about "flow"-
大家都了解过"流动"了

892
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,320
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who talks about flow
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi谈论过流动

893
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:11,770
is being peak experience we enjoy the most and peak performance-
是我们最良好的感受 最出色的表现

894
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:19,140
we perform at our best,defying the "no pain,no gain" formula.
也就是"没有付出就没有收获"

895
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,930
And when do we experience flow?
我们什么时候感受到流动

896
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,140
Not when we experience the high levels of anxiety
我们焦虑的时候感受不到

897
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,280
as the perfectionist often does,not when we are bored,
就如完美主义者那样 我们无聊时感受不到

898
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,310
but when it's the optimum levels of arousal,when we are excited.
只有我们乐观愉快 兴奋的时候感受得到

899
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,780
The person committed to excellence
追求卓越的人

900
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,240
is much more likely to experience the flow
更容易感觉到流动

901
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:38,220
than the person who is constantly afraid of failure,
而那些一直畏惧失败的人

902
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,890
constantly obsessed with failure,
一直为失败所困扰的人

903
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,030
constantly thinking about what if I fail.
一直在设想如果我失败了怎么办的人

904
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,990
Let me talk a little bit about the sources of the perfectionism.
我来谈谈完美主义的根源吧

905
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,130
Because if we understand that,as I mentioned last time,
因为一旦我们明白 就如我上次说的

906
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,040
if we understand where it comes from,
一旦我们明白它是怎么来的

907
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,370
we are much more likely to be able to get over it.
我们就更能克服它

908
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:03,500
So some of these sources of perfectionism.
完美主义的根源

909
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,320
The first one,the most important one is conditioning.
第一个 最重要的因素就是社会影响

910
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,350
I mean we are not born perfectionist.
我们都不是天生的完美主义者

911
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,190
Children as you saw in the video- they are,as you know,
你们在录影带中看到的孩子 他们天生

912
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:17,320
born actually enjoying the learning process much more than we do.
比我们更能享受学习的过程

913
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,960
When we are afraid of failing,they fall and they get up again.
我们畏惧失败 他们却不断跌掉了又爬起

914
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,230
So it's through conditioning that
所以是社会的影响导致了

915
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,480
we learn to be afraid of failure,specifically,
我们对于失败的畏惧 确切地说

916
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,710
the schema that we internalize
是这样一种在我们心中烙下的

917
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,640
that's being reinforced constantly from almost the time
并且几乎从出生开始就不断被加深的基模

918
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:36,700
when we were born- that what matters is the destination.
那就是 成果才是真正重要的

919
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,260
When we get to a certain destination
当我们得到了某个成果的时候

920
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,250
such as learning how to walk- well done!
比如学会走路 做得好

921
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:49,090
Such as getting A at the end of my first grade- terrific!
在我第一年期末的时候得了A 真不错

922
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:54,480
Gold star! It's the destination that's rewarded.
只有我们的成果受到了奖励

923
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,930
And after a while,we begin to internalize this schema
过了没多久 我们就开始内化这种基模

924
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,190
and we begin to believe that we accept it
并且我们也开始相信我们接受它

925
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,170
when we achieve a certain completion
当我们达成了某种成就的时候

926
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,910
and goes on throughout our lives.
这样的事在我们的生活中一直延续着

927
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,900
I mean when do we get a bonus?
我们什么时候会得到奖金

928
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:16,240
On April 3? No,we get it on December 31!
在4月3号吗 当然不是 是在12月31号

929
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,990
Or just before Christmas at the end of the year.
或者说是圣诞节之前 年末

930
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:22,110
This was a good productive year.Well done.
今年大家都干得不错 很好

931
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,240
When do we get the grades,

932
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,450
the pats on the back if we did work well?

933
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,560
At the end of the semester.
是在学期末

934
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,630
Or after an exam when we have completed something.
或是在考试后 我们完成了某些事的时候

935
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,220
Not during the journey.
不会在旅途中得到

936
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:41,700
In other words,the journey goes unrewarded.
换句话说 整个旅途都没有受到奖励

937
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,440
And we begin to perceive it as inconsequential,
于是我们也就开始认为它是无关的

938
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,230
not important,just a means toward an end.
是不重要的 只是到达终点的一种方式

939
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:56,050
Very few teachers,parents,organizations,
只有非常少的教师 家长 组织

940
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:01,030
schools reward the journey- the enjoyment of the journey.
还有学校会奖励旅途 奖励旅途中的愉快

941
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,620
And of course,very few reward,lo and behold,failure,
当然 也有很少的人会奖励失败

942
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,790
which is an inevitable part of every journey
可这是旅途中不可避免的

943
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,910
so that we learn no good- this is no good-
所以我们觉得这不好 这一点也不好

944
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:20,270
we must have as much as possible a straight line.
我们必须尽可能地追求直线

945
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,450
A straight schema.
一种直接的基模

946
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,660
And we pay a price for it when we internalize it.
我们内化它的时候也付出了代价

947
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,310
And this is the kind of social environment that we are born into,
这就是我们出生所在的社会环境

948
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,410
that we are raised in,
我们成长所在的社会环境

949
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,580
and the social environment that is very difficult to change.

950
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,940
I mean I know- I have little kids at home.

951
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,910
It is so difficult to change it
这太难以改变了

952
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,220
because very often I'm inclined to say to focus
因为我自己也时常对孩子说并且专注于

953
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,660
from early on the day "Oh Shirell just learned how to walk!
"Shirell学会走路了

954
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,350
Well done! You know you just walk"
做得好 你学会走路了"

955
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,070
as opposed to rewarding the effort as we'll talk about
而不是奖励其中所付出的努力

956
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,070
in a minute and rewarding the hard work and
我们等会会讲到 奖励付出的努力

957
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,150
rewarding even the failure,the trying,the coping,the process.
甚至奖励失败 应对与整个过程

958
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,440
Very difficult.
非常难

959
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,990
And that's connected,of course,to the permission to be human.
这当然也和准许为人有联系

960
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,930
The permission for the constraint of view of the human nature,
准许看到人类本性的限制

961
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,040
as opposed to the idealized,disconnected,

00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,490
detached of view of what life can look like.
分离地看待生活

00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,170
Because it can't.
因为这不可能

964
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:22,600
Instead of permission to be human,there's pressure to be perfect
如果不是准许为人 而是要求完美的话

965
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,570
It's constant.It's on-going.

966
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,500
It's in the media.It's in the workplace.

It's in our educational institutions.

It's everywhere.And we pay a price for it.

Now let me give you some examples.

Before I give this example,just a quick introduction.

01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,670
that they can control.
一个他自己能掌控的变量

1139
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,560
They come to see themselves as in control of their success.
这能让他们认为自己能掌控自己的成功

1140
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,210
Emphasizing natural intelligence
强调自然的天赋

1141
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,300
takes it out of the child’s control,
让孩子们无法掌控成功

1142
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,520
and it provides no good recipe for responding to a failure."
这不会给孩子提供面对失败的方法

1143
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,490
Essentially what happens when you focus only on the intelligence,
事实上当你仅仅注重于天赋的时候

1144
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,240
on how smart you are,you are creating the perfectionist schema,
你就是在制造完美主义的基模

1145
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,700
as opposed to a schema that
而不是专注于

1146
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,220
focuses on the journey,effort,hard work.
旅途当中 努力的基模

1147
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,640
She continues-
她继续说道

1148
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,030
"When you praise kids' in telligence and then they fail,
"如果你称赞孩子的智力 当他们失败时

1149
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,000
they think they're not smart anymore,
他们会认为自己不再聪明

1150
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:57,370
and they lose interest in their work.
然后失去对于眼前工作的兴趣

1151
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,920
In contrast,kids praised for effort show no impairment
相反 那些被称赞努力的孩子

1152
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,850
and often are energized in the face of difficulty."
在困难面前不会气馁 甚至更有动力

1153
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,350
What a difference just based on these two approaches.
这两种方式造成了多么明显的不同

1154
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,880
Person who is praised for their intelligence creates this schema-
被称赞智力的人会产生这样的基模

1155
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,470
either I'm intelligent or I'm not.
要么我很聪明 要么我就不聪明

1156
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:21,890
And I'm afraid of not being intelligent,
我很畏惧不聪明

1157
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,570
so I'll choose the easier task.
所以我就选择容易一点的任务吧

1158
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:28,150
And when I can't do something,it's an attack,
当我无法做到的时候 这就是攻击

1159
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,920
it's an insult on my schema,right?
是对于我的基模的侮辱 没错吧

1160
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:35,130
It's a deviation from this straight narrow.
这是对于直线的偏离

1161
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,480
In contrast,if effort is most important,
相对的 如果努力才是最重要的

1162
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,310
"OK,let me see what's around the corner here."
"好的 让我试试看吧"

1163
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,530
"Hey I'm learning a lot now.This is wonderful.This is fun."
"我学到了很多 这真有意思"

1164
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,460
Because with one,it's "a fixed mindset",in Dweck's words.
因为 一个是"既定思维模式"如Dweck所说

1165
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:52,430
And in the other,
而另一个

1166
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:57,410
it's the malleable,changing,ongoing,developing mindset.
是种可拓展的 时刻改变和发展的思维模式

1167
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:01,670
One- there is fear of failure,cause I want to be smart.
一个是 畏惧失败 因为我想聪明

1168
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:04,330
It's fun being called smart and intelligent.
被人称赞聪明很有意思

1169
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,040
I don't want to threaten the schema.
我不想威胁到这个基模

1170
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,710
Versus working hard,focusing on the process,
相对的是 努力的 重视过程的

1171
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:15,330
when the excellence schema
当追求卓越的基模

1172
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:22,150
becomes the dominant modus operandi.OK.
成为惯常做法

1173
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,460
So how do we overcome perfectionism?
那么我们如何克服完美主义呢

1174
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,140
What do we do about it if we have it?
如果我们确实有这个问题怎么办

1175
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,020
And again,remember there's no perfect perfectionist.
要记住 根本就没有完美的完美主义者

1176
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,430
There is no perfect person committed to excellence.
也没有完美的追求卓越者

1177
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,890
You need to choose in your life where you are happy,
你们必须选择你能快乐的生活方式

1178
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,810
and where you think you can be happier.
选择你认为能够更加快乐的生活方式

1179
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,170
This may not even speak to you.
不会有现成的答案摆在你面前

1180
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,590
This for you may be just interesting academically,
对你而言可能只是有趣的学术理论

1181
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,790
or it may be deeply personal.
或者是非常个人化的原因

1182
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:52,820
So how do we become more and more of the excellence schema?
那么我们该怎么更多地采用卓越的基模呢

1183
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:59,840
First,it is about self-awareness.It's about understanding.
首先 是自我认知 在于自我了解

1184
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,130
For me,a big breakthrough was understanding
对我来说 明白 "我太过于有自卫性了

1185
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:05,960
"hey I'm actually defensive and I don't want to be defensive."
我不想再这样了"是一个大突破

1186
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,530
Because I know that it hurts intimacy and relationships
因为我知道这会伤害亲密的人际关系

1187
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,470
and that's when I started the real work on it.
并且从那时候我开始在这上面努力

1188
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:13,560
And that has improved,
并且有所进步

1189
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,140
and continues to improve my relationships.
并且在将来仍将继续提升我的人际关系

1190
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:20,040
Or "look at my reaction to failure.
或者"看看我有多么畏惧失败

1191
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,370
Look how afraid I am of hearing a no.
我有多么害怕听到个不字

1192
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,490
Look how afraid I am of being rejected.
看看我有多么害怕被拒绝

1193
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,640
Look how afraid I am of coping and trying."
看看我有多害怕应对与尝试"

1194
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,250
So being aware of it.
就应该意识到它

1195
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,650
I mean,if you want to improve your forehand in tennis,
如果你想让你的网球技术进步

1196
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,960
you first need to be aware of what it is that you want to improve
你必须首先明白你想要进步的是什么

1197
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:40,260
So that's the first step.And that's easier said than done.
这就是第一步 说起来容易做起来难

1198
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,340
Let me show you a quick example of someone
我来给你们介绍一个简短的例子

1199
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:48,840
who perhaps is not fully aware of her weaknesses.
是关于一个不完全了解自己的弱点的人的

where it's a capital crime to even say the word "coffee"?
