11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,350
right here in the Art.

And the exam is about metaphysics,and the meaning of life.

I was thinking of having the class outside,

but I think - maybe we should.Yeah.

What we are going to do today is finish up on relationships -
今天我们要讲完爱情

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,990
we have just a little to go,
还差一点就讲完了

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,900
and then start with our final topic for the course,
然后我们会开始讲本课程最后一个话题

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,950
which is self-esteem.
也就是自尊

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,960
So let me just recap what we did when we discussed relationships.
先回顾一下上回讲到的关于爱情的内容

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,600
So we talked about how do we - given our natures,
我们讲到了人类要如何…考虑到人的本性

32
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,810
how do we attain,how do we sustain lasting love,
人类要如何获得 维持长久的爱情与激情

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,460
lasting passion when it seems on the physiological level at least
因为从心理学角度看

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,420
that our natures are not attuned to that approach.
这似乎有违人的本性

35
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,520
And we talked about - when studying the best relationships,
当我们讲到研究那些最成功的恋情时

36
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,540
the "tip of the stem" - four characteristics,
最成功的恋情有四个特点

37
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,360
based on the work of David Schnarch and John Gottman.
根据David Schnarch和John Gottman的研究发现的

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,950
The first one is: relationship is the hard work.
第一条是 经营爱情需要付出努力

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,260
It's an illusion to think that
人们往往误以为

40
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,610
the most important thing is finding the right relationship;
寻找合适的爱情对象是最重要的

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,980
it is more important to cultivate that one chosen relationship.
其实更重要的是如何经营你选择的爱情

42
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,530
And just like we would not thrive,succeed at work,
就跟工作一样 如果我们找到了梦想中的工作

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,100
if we said,"Well,I just found my dream job,"
然后翘起腿 什么也不做

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,750
and then put our legs up and relax;
是不可能成功的

45
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,880
similarly we would not thrive in a relationship,
同样的 如果我们在一段恋情中抱有寻找心态

46
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,620
if we have the finding mindset -
我们的恋情也不会成功

47
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,280
we just need to find it and we will live happily ever after,
以为只要找到爱情就能幸福地生活下去

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,230
as we talked about movies and where love begins.
我们说过 电影结束时 正是爱情刚开始时

49
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,250
The second component of a healthy,
一段健康长久充满激情的爱情

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,010
lasting and passionate relationship related to the first one
第二个组成部分 跟第一个有关联

51
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,010
is the notion of being known rather than being validated,
我们要被了解 而不是被认可

52
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,640
expressing rather than impressing,being open,
表达自己 而不是粉饰自己 坦开心扉

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,400
revealing our weaknesses as well as our strengths,our desires,
坦诚自己的弱点 优点 渴望

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,560
our passions,our fears and insecurities.

55
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,770
And relationships that do,
这样的爱情

56
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,320
or partners that do that within a relationship,
恋爱中的双方如果这样做了

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,150
over time attain higher and higher levels of intimacy,happiness,
会渐渐变得更加亲密 更加快乐

58
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,240
and they thrive,and they remain - maintain their passion.
感情更好 激情不哀

59
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,250
That's the second component.
这是第二个组成部分

60
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:51,070
The third component of a healthy relationship is that
健康爱情的第三个组成部分是

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,240
there are conflicts there.
冲突是不可避免的

62
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,380
It is an illusion to believe that
人们往往误以为

63
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,660
the ideal relationship is one that is conflict free
理想的爱情没有冲突

64
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,260
that doesn't exist,
这是不可能的

65
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,240
unless both partners are suppressing serious issues.
除非双方都在刻意躲避严重问题

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,190
So there are conflicts in relationships.
所以爱情中时有冲突发生

67
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,800
The challenge is to have more positivity than negativity
当然在一段恋情中 我们的挑战就是要

68
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,040
of course in a relationship,
让积极的大于消极的

69
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,340
but also to learn how to be in the midst of disagreement,
而且要学会如何应对分歧

70
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,050
how to have conflict.
应对冲突

71
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,640
And finally,
最后

72
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,180
the fourth point that we talked about was positive perception;
第四点是积极认知

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,010
being a benefit finder,and more than that,
要做优点感知者 不仅如此

74
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,870
being a benefit creator.
还要创造优点

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,420
I want to just go back quickly
我快快回顾一遍

76
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,930
and elaborate on something that I didn't last time

about the conflict or conflicts within a relationship.

article that I read about relationships in general
关于爱情最重要的文章

a person who would agree with everything that I say;

who will help me in my apprenticeship to the truth."

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,020
A conflict free relationship is
没有冲突的爱情

where there are no beautiful enemies.
就没有美丽的敌人

93

A beautiful enemy is a person who loves us,
美丽的敌人是指因为爱我们

94
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,770
who cares about us enough to challenge us,enough to disagree.
关心我们 所以要跟我们针锋相对的人

95
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,310
And ask yourself what kind of friend,

101
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,860
this whole idea of beautiful enemy goes way back
美丽敌人这一概念最早可以追溯到

102
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,670
it goes back to the most influential text
西方世界

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,440
in certainly the Western world,which is the Bible.
最有影响力的文本 即圣经

104
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,810
In Genesis,God sees that man is alone.
在创世纪中 上帝看到男人独居

105
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:33,170
So he creates a help meet for him,a woman.A helpmeet.
于是为他造一个配偶帮助他 一个女人 helpmeet

106
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,210
What does that phrase mean? This is the King James translation.
helpmeet这个词是什么意思? 这是钦定版圣经的翻译

107
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,050
Well,if you look at it in the Hebrew,original,
如果你看希伯来原文

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,360
"helpmeet" is "ezer kenegdoor",or help as opposition.
"helpmeet"的原文是"ezer kenegdoor" 对立的帮助

109
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,990
In other words,the helpmeet translation,the meet part,M-E-E-T,
也就是说 helpmeet中meet的意思

110
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,870
is like athletic meet,like a competition.
类似运动会的会 也就是竞争

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,010
Not helping and they meet together - it's help as opposition.
不是指帮助并取得共识 而是对立的帮助

112
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,510
And already then that it was notices the ideal relationship
所以那时人们已经注意到 理想的爱情

113
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,480
is not one which is all smooth,conflict free;
不是一帆风顺 没有冲突的

114
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,680
it is one where there is some resistance.
而是有阻力的

115
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,790
And it's this resistance that Gottman talked about in the - or
这种阻力就是Gottman曾经谈到…

116
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,690
he is talking about in the 2ast century that it is so important,
本世纪一直谈到的 对于健康的爱情关系

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,200
so critical for a healthy relationship,a beautiful enemy,
非常重要且关键的

118
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,630
help as opposition,helpmeet,
一个美丽的敌人 对立的帮助

119
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,490
again with a lot of positivity in the relationship as well.
当然还要有积极的态度

120
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,690
So we move on,and just finish up on positive perception.
我们继续讲积极认知

121
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,940
I want to show you an excerpt from one of my favorite movie

126
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,300
and it'd better be a good compliment.

127
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,120
Because if it is not,she's getting up and leaving.
否则她就马上离开

128
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,840
He just said something very offensive to her.

So here is what he has to say to the woman he loves.

Don't be pessimistic.It's not your style.

Okay,here I go: Clearly,a mistake.

Very often it's right in front of us.

meaning - what we saw last time - how do you disagree,

rather than an affective or emotional disagreement

Again,remember,the ratio 21 to 1.

Now it's a little bit less,

especially after the honey moon phase.

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,910
So when initially the physiological,the novelty,

the excitement is there,it happens more often.

312
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,450
and with it,as Shelly Gable has shown,

the success of the relationship in a long term.
这段关系就很难长久下去

314
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,710

315
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,930
it applies to numerous areas in our lives,

as a therapist,how I communicate with my clients,

325
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,280
It doesn't mean that

326
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,160
it's the right approach in every relationship every time,
这在任何时候都是最正确的方法

327

because there are a few constraints here.

For example - it has to be win-win events.

329
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,040
Let's say my partner comes from work and says,

"Tal,you won't believe it.

Now active constructive: Do tell more and what happened then?

in the situation for most people.
很难做到主动且有建设性

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,040

337
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,190
That's not a win-win as far as I can see.It has to be a win-win.
至少我看来 刚才这个例子不是双赢 必须是双赢

338
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,540
In other words,something that both of us

or the relationship will benefit from,or at the very least,

341
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,720

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,980
It cannot be fake,because that can't

343
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,650
especially once the partner knows you
尤其是一旦伴侣发现

344
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,370
over time it just doesn't work.
慢慢地就会出现问题

345
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,300
It has to be genuine,
所以必须是真诚的

346
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,690
meaning we have to get into the role of our partner,

347
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,980
identify with,empathize with,

如果我们能做出真诚的回应 如果这是一个双赢事件

350
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,110
that's when it generates upward spiral on a few levels.
就会带来几个良性循环

351
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,080
First of all: remember,
首先 记得吗

352
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,840
usually when a positive event happens,what happens?
通常当积极事件发生时 会怎么样

353
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,700
There is a spike up and then affective forecasting

354
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,950
Gilbert's work - shows goes back down again.

00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,950
which is "OK,tell me more.

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,650
So how was it? Let's celebrate! Give me more details.

I wanna know! I'm interested!"

What it does to the spike is prolong it.

It actually keeps it going for much longer

361
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,390
than it would have been just a positive event

362
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,840
and then back to the base level.
很快回落到基本水平

363
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,230
Because we know no matter what promotion we get at work,

364
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,720

no matter what raise initially it feels wonderful,

and then it goes back down again to base level.
然后又会回到基本水平

367
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,220

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,830
that improvement in well being.

369
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,370
So that is one spiral that it creates - feeling better.
所以这是其中一个良性循环 更好的感觉

370
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,620
The second spiral is an inter-personal spiral,
另一种良性循环 是人际关系的

371
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,180
meaning a person who actively constructively responds genuinely

372
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,900
enters the same upward spiral,
会获得相同的良性循环

373
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,570
meaning people
也就是说

374
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,370
who do that genuinely become happier as a result of
真诚回应的人会变得更快乐

375
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,350
because they experience the event.

And they themselves benefit and become happier,

377
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,510
again a win-win potentially.
所以又是一种双赢

378
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,500
And finally,it also does what positive psychology

379
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,160
as a whole does which is build positive capacity.

380
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,200
Remember positive psychology

381
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,030
takes us not just from the zero to the positive,
不仅让我们从0变得积极

382
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,450
it also helps us better deal with the negative to the zero.
还帮助我们更好地把消极变为0

383

Partners who actively constructive respond to one another

384
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,100
are building capacity for hard times.
是在为艰难时刻累积积极正面情绪

385
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,200
In fact one of the most interesting research that
事实上 很久以前

386
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,170
were done long time ago was that couples
有一项有趣的实验

387
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,250
when things went well or they were - wasn't,
当生活顺利时 夫妻双方…

388
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,100
that language wasn't used - but essentially
虽然当时的研究没有用这样的术语 但意思上是相同的

389
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,840
when they actively constructively responded to one another
1920年代 夫妻双方能主动

390
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,350
and supported one another back in the 1920s,
且有建设性地回应对方 支持对方

391

the relationship actually became better;
他们的婚姻反而变得更坚固了

393
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,530
whereas partners who didn't have a good before,
而没有做到这点的伴侣

394
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,360
the relationship very often dissolved,became worse.
他们的婚姻往往会瓦解 变糟

395
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,570
In other words,when they built the capacity,
换句话说 他们累积正面情绪

396
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,900
it helped them also deal with the hard times
应对困难时期

397
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,450
such as 1929 and the 1930s.

398
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,410
There are no short cuts when it comes to good relationships,
幸福的爱情 健康的爱情

399
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,020
to healthy relationships.
没有捷径

400
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,700
It is hard work,if you want to succeed,
如果你想要成功 就需要努力

401
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,340
just like it is in every other domain in life.

402
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,880
There are no short cuts.

403
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,060
However,that doesn't mean that hard work cannot be enjoyable,

404
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,970
cannot be pleasurable as well as meaningful.

I want to end but just addressing a point that

409
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,160
many of you have raised with me:
你们很多人都问过我

410
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,730
and that is should we even talk about relationships
当我们讲追求幸福时

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,940
in the context of pursuit of happiness.
我们应该讲恋情吗?

412
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,340
And the answer for most people is yes with some discomfort.
大多数人的回答是 应该 但有所保留

413
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,090
Yes,because it is the No.1 generator of the ultimate currency;
说"是"的原因是 爱情是幸福的最重要来源

414
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,510
some discomfort
有所保留的原因是

415
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,810
because pursuing happiness is by its nature selfish.

416
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,780
I mean actually when I am thinking about my happiness,

417
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,730
I'm thinking by definition about the self.
毫无疑问 我想的是自己

418
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,950
And shouldn't relationship be about the opposite of selfishness,
难道恋情不是与自私对立的吗

419
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,350
in other words,about altruism.
换句话说 恋情是利他主义的

420
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,560
So let me just say a few words about this.
关于这点我有几句话要说

421
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,470
Let's take an example from teaching.
就拿教书作为例子

422
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:12,280
Imagine this: imagine that I actually don't like teaching.

426
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,930
However,I have a deep sense of duty because of my upbringing,

because of the philosophies that I read.

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,360
or has some important messages to give people.
给教给别人一些很重要的知识

431
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,290
And therefore I teach it,not because I like it,
于是我来上课 不是因为我喜欢教书

432
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,170
but because I think it can potentially help other people.
而是因为我认为它能帮助到别人

433
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,880
And I wake up in Tuesdays and Thursdays mornings,
我每周二周四早上醒来

434
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,940
and I dread going to class.
痛苦地来到教室

435
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,100
The hour and a half seems like eternity to me.
一个半小时的课让我度日如年

436
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,390
The last thing in the world that I want to do is teach,
我最不想做的事就是教书

437
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,370
but I'm driven by my sense of duty,because I'm an altruist,
但是我的责任感驱使我这样 因为我是利他主义者

438
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,490
I'm sacrificing myself for what I think is a greater good.
我为伟大的事业牺牲自己

439
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,050
Now think of the alternative.
再想想另一种情况

440
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,470
Imagine this teacher and then imagine the alternative.
想象与刚才那位老师相反的情况

441
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,630
And the alternative is me.
就是我

442
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,810
I love teaching.
我爱教书

443
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,620
There is no where else I would rather be right now than here.
我最喜欢的地方就是教室的讲台

444
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,280
I love positive psychology.
我爱积极心理学

445
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,410
I can't wait to get onto my computer and write the lectures;
我等不及要打开电脑备课

446
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,530
I can't wait to prepare the powerpoints
等不及准备幻灯片

447
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,580
and work hard on Google image to do so;
搜索Google图片

448
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,270
I can't hardly wait to interact with you.
我等不及要与你们互动

449
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,840
I love being here every Tuesday and Thursday.
我喜欢每周二周四站在这里

450
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,260
It is my passion,it is my calling,
这是我热爱的 我的使命

451
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,410
it is both pleasurable and meaningful to me
和你们在一起上课 对我来说

452
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,130
to spend time with you.
意义非凡又充满乐趣

453
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,990
And now I ask you which teacher would you rather have?
那么你们想要哪一位老师

454
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,130
The teacher who is here out of a sense of duty,
是出于责任和利他主义动机

455
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,780
for altruistic reasons?
才来上课的老师

456
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,810
Or is the person who is here for selfish reasons,
还是那个为了满足自己

457
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,550
because he would rather be here more than any other place?
喜欢上课这个爱好而来上课的老师?

458
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,060
I also ask you
另一个问题

459
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,480
which teacher do you think would be a better teacher?
你觉得哪个老师会是更好的老师

460
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,550
And now I ask you,which partner would you rather have,
引申开去 你们会想要怎样的伴侣

461
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,320
a partner who is with you just because they feel like
一个跟你在一起是因为他们觉得

462
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,150
"Well,that person really needs me,"
"这人很需要我"

463
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,910
or "I feel sorry for the person,"
"这家伙真可怜"

464
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,350
"I don't really like that person,but I'm there
"我不是真的喜欢他

465
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,830
just to be there for them,because,out of a sense of duty"?
我只是出于责任感 支持他"的人?

466
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,920
Or would you rather have a person who is with you
还是跟你在一起是因为

467
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,910
because you are the most important person in their lives,
你是他们生命中最重要的人

468
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,980
because they care about so much that the I becomes the We?
因为他们如此关心你 从"我"变成了"我们"?

469
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,150
They care about you as much as they care about themselves.
他们像关心自己一样 关心你

470
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,980
They include you in their circle of the self.
把你纳入了自己的一部分

471
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,560
Which relationship do you think will thrive more?
你们认为哪种爱情会成功?

472
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,400
Now that does not mean that
这不是说

473
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,840
there is no sacrificing in relationships;
爱情中不会有牺牲

474
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,460
that does not mean that if my partner is unwell,
也不是说 如果我伴侣身体不适

475
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,580
or needs my help,I would not go out of my way,
或者需要我帮助 我不会全力以赴

476
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,490
even if it means giving up something that
即使那意味着需要放弃

477
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,290
I really really want to do at that point.
我当时的梦想

478
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,130
Of course,in healthy relationships,
当然了 在健康的恋情中

479
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,900
when the Is become a We,sacrifices exist,
当我变成了我们 就会有牺牲

480
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,770
and there is healthy sacrifice.
但这是健康的牺牲

481
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,580
But it's not a relationship that
这样的恋情

482
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,410
is based fundamentally on the sense of duty
它的基础不是责任感

483
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,750
or altruistic negation of the self.
不是否定自我的利他主义

484
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,860
As Nathaniel Branden says,the more independent we are,
Nathaniel Branden说过 我们越独立

485
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,210
the more inter-dependent we can become.
就越互相依赖

486
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,680
That's when the I becomes a We.
当我变成我们时 就会这样

487
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,320
Again this is something which goes against much of our teachings
这与我们所讲过的内容相反

488
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,020
it's not always easy to accept,but again
不是很容易接受

489
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,150
this class much more than it is about positive psychology,
但是这门课不仅是关于积极心理学

490
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,390
is about reality psychology.
还有现实心理学

491
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,250
And ask yourself what partner would you rather be,
问问你自己 想成为哪种伴侣

492
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,560
what partner would you rather have,
想拥有哪种伴侣

493
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,610
what teacher would you rather have - completely analogous.
想要哪种老师 举一反三

494
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,430
OK.Let's move on now to the very last topic of this class.
好了 我们来讲本课程最后一个话题

495
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,340
As I've said many times,I never procrastinate;
我说过很多次 我从不拖延

496
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,060
I just use Google image.
直接用了Google图片

497
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,540
I started to think explicitly about the topic about self-esteem
当我还在哈佛这里读本科大四时

498
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,440
when I was a senior,as an undergraduate here.
就开始非常认真地思考自尊这个话题

499
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,090
I started to think about it when I noticed another phenomenon.
当时我注意到一个现象

500
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,650
So that was after I switched into philosophy and psychology.
那是我转专业到哲学和心理学后

501
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,450
I was very happy on my concentration.
我对自己的学业很满意

502
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,230
I was very happy playing in the squash team.
在壁球队里也很开心

503
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,010
Harvard was going great for me.
哈佛生活对我来说一帆风顺

504
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,060
But then I started to notice something that was unclear,
但后来我发现一些很费解

505
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,770
didn't make sense to me.
无法理解的事情

506
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,950
And that was the fact that I had low self-esteem
我自尊程度相当低

507
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,990
or so it seemed at least.
至少看起来是这样

508
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,740
And it didn't make sense to me,
我无法理解

509
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,910
because I was doing well,I had won prizes,
因为我表现不错 得过奖

510
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,930
I had received a lot of accolades,a lot of support,
屡获表扬 支持

511
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,070
whether it's from my roommates,friends,family,
有来自室友的 朋友的 家人的

512
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,530
lot of pads on the back in athletics,in academics.
运动还是学术都屡获嘉奖

513
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,620
And yet I had low self-esteem.
但我的自尊还是很低

514
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,280
And it just didn't make any sense to me.
这让我很不解

515
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,350
There was another thing that baffled me even more.
还有一件事更让我困惑

516
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,860
It was as if on some level I was punished by success.
在某种程度上 我觉得我的成功在惩罚我

517
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,540
What do I mean by that?
这是什么意思?

518
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,300
Every time when I would succeed,or when I did get praise,
每次我获得成功 或者被表扬

519
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,140
my self-esteem would increase,would improve.
我的自尊就会增加 改进

520
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,220
But then very quickly afterwards,
但很快

521
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,070
it went down,back to its base level and even lower.
又回到了基础水平 甚至更低

522
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,690
And in order to raise it back up again,
为了重新提升它

523
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,310
I needed even more praise,
我就需要更多表扬

524
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,040
even more accolades than I needed before.
比以前更多的赞赏

525
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,770
And the metaphor that kept coming to mind
有一个比喻不断出现在我脑海里

526
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,200
was Sisyphus pushing a rock up on mountain.
科林斯王推石头上山的故事

527
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,240
I would push the rock up the mountain,
我就好像在推石头上山

528
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,600
struggle till the next victory came.
挣扎奋斗直到获得成功

529
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,330
And the next victory came and I got the praise,
成功后我得到表扬

530
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,930
I got the accolades,I got the prize.
获得赞赏 奖品

531
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,810
And my self-esteem was high.
我的自尊提升了

532
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,630
I was on top of the mountain.
我处在了山顶

533
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,080
And then this rock would be rolled down again.
然后石头又滚了下来

534
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,720
And I would have to run down and start to push it up again
我不得不跑下山重新再推

535
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,130
only this time,the hill was even steeper;
而且这次 山坡更陡峭了

536
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:24,720
I would have to struggle even more and I would get up there again
我不得不更加努力 才能到达山顶

537
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,350
and then it would roll back down.
然后石头又滚下山

538
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,120
Now it wasn't enough to have the accolade,the praise,the amount
以前那些赞赏 表扬

539
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,470
the quality and the quantity that I had before.
已经不够了

540
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,330
I needed even more just to get onto the same mountain,
我需要更多才能重新回到山顶

541
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,090
even steeper,even more difficult.
更陡峭 更困难

542
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,160
And it didn't make sense to me.
我想不通

543
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,040
And then I took a class - senior year
到了大四 我选修了一门课

544
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,680
ended up being one of my favorite classes for various reasons
出于诸多原因 那成为了我最爱的课程之一

545
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,270
which I will not go into now,Fairy Tales.
童话课 原因我现在不想细讲

546
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,230
I took Fairy Tales and we read Emile, Rousseau's Emile
我选修了童话课 我们读了卢梭的《爱弥儿》

547
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:12,170
And Maria Tatar talked about wonderful theories and it clicked.
Maria Tatar讲到了很多精彩的理论 我想通了

548
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,330
I ended up writing my senior thesis,
于是我的毕业论文

549
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,720
my final paper for that class on self-esteem
那门课的期末论文写的就是自尊

550
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,510
and that eventually became my dissertation.
最终发展成了我的学位论文

551
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,440
That's actually what I wrote my PHD on,this topic.
我的博士论文写的就是这个话题

552
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:31,340
So what I want to do today is show with you some of the insights
所以今天我想和大家分享

553
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:39,450
that I got in Fairy Tales as well as other thinkers
我在童话课上的感悟及其他思想家

554
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,350
who have been thinking about this topic of self-esteem,
对于自尊话题的思考

555
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,200
because it is important.
因为这非常重要

556
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,100
It is not for nothing that
我以自尊的话题结束这门课程

557
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,540
I end the course with the topic of self-esteem,
不是毫无缘由的

558
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,100
because it is at the foundation,
因为它是基础

559
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,220
at the core of so many of the other things that we discussed,
是我们之前讲过的很多内容的核心

560
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,270
whether it's healthy relationships,
无论是健康的婚恋关系

561
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,790
whether it's happiness in general,
还是快乐

562
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,720
whether it's benefit finding or benefit creating,
无论是寻找优点 还是创造优点

563
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,490
whether it's being known rather than validated.
无论是被了解 还是被认可

564
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,910
Self-esteem encompasses so many of these ideas.
自尊涉及方方面面的内容

565
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,930
So here is what we are gonna do.
我们要讲以下内容

566
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,960
First of all,we are going to talk about why is it important?
首先 为什么自尊非常重要

567
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,170
A lot of misunderstanding about what self-esteem is and is not.
对于自尊的种种误解

568
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,980
We are going to talk about some theories
可以运用到生活中的

569
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,810
that can apply to our lives.
一些理论

570
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,230
And then we'll elaborate on the paradox that I just talked about,
然后我们会细讲我刚才提到的矛盾

571
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,770
that sometimes success actually
有时候成功

572
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,090
leads to lower levels of self-esteem.
会降低自尊

573
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,050
And why does that happen? We'll explain that.And
为什么会这样 我们到时会解释

574
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,010
then I'll introduce essentially my dissertation on self-esteem,
然后我会介绍我关于自尊的学位论文

575
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:48,160
where I divided the one construct into three distinct components,
我把它分为三个清晰的部分

576
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,340
which are dependence self-esteem
依赖性自尊

577
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:55,060
self-esteem that is generated by others' praise or approval;
即由他人表扬和认同而产生的自尊

578
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,500
independence self-esteem - self-esteem that comes from within,
独立自尊 即内在产生的自尊

579
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,610
self-esteem that is not contingent
这种自尊不取决于

580
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,370
on what other people say,self generated;
别人的评价 是自我生成的

581
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,520
and finally,unconditional self-esteem,or a state of being,
最后 无条件的自尊 也可以称作一种自然状态

582
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,290
where we simply and naturally exist.
我们自然的存在感

583
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,390
So I'll talk about these three levels
我会讲到这三个层面的自尊

584
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,810
and how we can cultivate independent
以及如何培养独立自尊

585
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,840
as well as unconditional self-esteem.
及无条件自尊

586
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,600
And finally we will end by next time by talking about
最后 下节课我们会讲到

587
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,980
how we can enhance our levels of self-esteem.
如何提高自尊水平

588
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,940
Now many people when they listen to a lecture on self-esteem,
很多人参加自尊讲座后

589
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,250
go into evaluation mode and say,
会进行自我评估 认为

590
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,950
"OK,so do I have high self-esteem?" - I meaning you;
"好了 我的自尊高吗?" 我说的"我"是说你们

591
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,190
or "Is my self-esteem higher than the person sitting next to me,
或者"我的自尊比旁边那人高吗?

592
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,410
or my partner or friend?"
比我伴侣或朋友高吗?"

593
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,520
And the answer to this question is you can't really know,
回答是 你无法得知

594
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,520
meaning we can't measure self-esteem "objectively".
因为我们无法客观地衡量自尊

595
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,440
We don't really where it is in the brain yet
我们还不知道它处在我们大脑哪个部位

596
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,960
we may be able to 10 years from now,20 years from now.
也许10年20年后可以

597
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,750
But that's not an important question,just like "Am I happy?"
但这个问题不重要 就像"我快乐吗"一样

598
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,320
or not is not an important question,
也不是个重要问题

599
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,170
in fact a misleading question.
它其实是一个误导人的问题

600
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,060
The question rather,remember,is "How can I become happier?"
记住 你要问的应该是"如何才能变得更快乐?"

601
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,760
The same with self-esteem
自尊也是如此

602
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,610
the question is not "Do I have high or low self-esteem?"
你要问的不是"我的自尊是高是低"

603
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,850
but rather "How can I enhance my self-esteem?"
而是"如何才能提高自尊"

604
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,500
Because as I argue shortly,there cannot be too much self-esteem.
因为我等一下会讲到 自尊越高越好

605
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,840
But sometimes people associate too much self-esteem to arrogance,
但有时候人们把自尊与自大

606
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,630
conceit and narcissism.
自负 自恋过多地联系在一起

607
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,590
It's not self-esteem.
这些不是自尊

608
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,940
In fact it is the exact opposite of it; it's lack thereof.
恰恰相反 是缺乏自尊

609
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,840
So having stronger sense of self is a good thing.
所以强烈的自我感是件好事

610
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,090
And the question is "How can I enhance it?"
问题是"如何提升它?"

611
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,920
Today my self-esteem is higher than it was
今天 我的自尊比15年前

612
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,870
when I started thinking about it 15 years ago.
我刚考虑这个问题时提升了很多

613
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,480
And hopefully 15 years or 5 years from now
希望5或15年后

614
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,730
it will be higher than it is today.
会比今天还要高

615
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,530
It is a life-long process.
这是个终身的过程

616
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,260
And we'll talk about how that life-long process unfolds
我们会谈这个终身过程是如何展开的

617
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,470
and what we can do to expedite it,to intensify it.
如何才能加快 加强这一过程

618
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,240
So first of all: definition of the self-esteem.
首先 自尊的定义

619
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,170
There are numerous definitions.
自尊有多种定义

640

is expressed in the attitudes individual holds toward himself."

641
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,230
It's about the attitude that I have toward myself.

642
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,620
It's the evaluative part of the self concept.

If we lack one,we very often have low self-esteem.
缺少任何一个 自尊就会很低

659
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,810
Personal example: I felt very competent at what I was doing,

660
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,380
whether it was on the squash court,

whether it was in relationships,

00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,270
whether it was academically,and yet my self-esteem was low,

because I didn't have the worthiness component

now I know of self-esteem.

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,530
So one or the other are not enough - we need both.

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,880
none is as important as the one we pass on ourselves."
没有哪个比对自己作出的判断更重要了"

669
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,790
Why? Because we are constantly with ourselves.
为什么 因为我们时刻有自我意识

670

It affects every area of our lives when we are alone,

when we are with others,when we are at work,when we are doing,

when we are working by ourselves,when we are in a team.

As Goethe said,"The greatest evil that can befall man is that

674
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,430
he should come to think ill of himself."
让他否认自己"

675
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,680
So high self-esteem is important or self-esteem is

the sense of self is important.
自我感很重要

677
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,220
And yet,if we look around us,
但是如果我们环顾四周

678
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,490
if we look within us,there's much room for improvement.
反省自身 会发现还有很多改进空间

679

Some people more than others,

Here are some of the benefits associated with high self-esteem.

High levels of resilience,dealing with difficulties

从6岁孩童到96岁老人都是这样

685
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,610
Throughout our lives,the higher levels of self-esteem,

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,520
the more resilient we are,

00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,910
the better we are able to deal with anxiety,with depression,

as we'll see later to romantic relationships;

In the words of Branden: Self concept is destiny.

had for highly successful HBS grads:

The second was they believed in themselves.

716
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,360
very high correlation,not the only determinant,

but certainly one of the major determinants of happiness.

00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,100
On the other hand,low self-esteem is associated with anxiety.

I'm not talking about the natural kind of anxiety.

If I'm standing on the cliff,

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,720
and I feel some anxiety looking down,that's natural.

00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,670
It's natural.
这很自然

725
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,580
We all do it,just like the law of gravity.
人人都会感受到 就像万有引力定律

726
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,980
It's part of our physical nature.
是我们的生理天性之一

727
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,290
Anxiety is part of human nature.
焦虑是人的天性之一

728
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,330
But anxiety that is unhealthy
不健康的焦虑

729
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,440
is one that is for no apparent reason.
是指毫无缘由的焦虑

730
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,790
Again,Branden calls it self-esteem anxiety.
Branden称之为自尊焦虑

731
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,300
Suddenly waking up in the middle of night
半夜突然醒来

732
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,980
and feeling anxiety for no apparent reason,
感到毫无缘由的焦虑

733
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,550
or going through life generally with a sense of anx or fear,
或者日常生活中经常感到一种焦虑感或恐惧感

734
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,610
not really clear,not really sure of what.
却不明白是为了什么

735
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,750
That is very often the symptom of low self-esteem.Depression.
这通常是低自尊的症状 抑郁

736
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,420
Again we are constantly spending time with ourselves.
我们时刻有自我意识

737
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,740
We are constantly inside of our minds -
我们时刻关注自己的脑袋

738
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,940
the I is constantly evaluating the me.
我时常在评估自己

739
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,820
And if the evaluation is wanting,
如果评估显示不够格

740
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,540
if it's low,very often it leads to depression.
如果评估很低 通常会导致抑郁

741
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:05,720
Psychosomatic symptoms include insomnia,include getting sick,
身心失调症状包括失眠 患病

742
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,370
because our immune system is lower -
因为我们的免疫系统变得脆弱

743
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,330
physical immune system is lower and so on.
生理免疫系统变得脆弱

744
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,960
Self concept is destiny.
自我概念即命运

745
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,930
It applies to our top performance;
它是我们取得最高效率的原因

746
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,810
it applies to our worst performance as well.
也是我们取得最差表现的原因

747
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,970
School children who are under achievers very often -
成绩差的学生通常…

748
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,830
that's associated or the result of low self-esteem.
自尊较低

749
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,940
Nathaniel Branden calls self-esteem
Nathaniel Branden把自尊称为

750
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,570
"the immune system of consciousness".
"意识的免疫系统"

751
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,850
The immune system of consciousness
意识的免疫系统

752
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,130
when we have high self-esteem,
我们自尊较高时

753
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,600
it means we are more resilient psychologically.
心理抵抗能力更强

754
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,070
Remember,a strong immune system does not mean we don't get sick.
记住 强健的免疫系统并不意味着不会生病

755
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,490
It means we get sick but less often;
而是较少得病

756
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,790
and when we do get sick,we recover more promptly.
如果生病了 能更迅速地恢复

757
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,470
The immune system of consciousness.
意识的免疫系统

758
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,070
It means that sickness is the exception; well being is the rule.
强健的意识疫系统 意味着我们常快乐少生病

759
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,910
It means that we are pursuing happiness,
意味着我们追求快乐

760
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,150
rather than constantly running away from unhappiness.
而不是躲避不快乐

761
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:11,810
These are all signs of high self-esteem versus low self-esteem
这些是高自尊与低自尊的区别

762
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,040
resilient psychology.
心理抵抗能力

763
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,690
Bednar and Peterson,
Bednar与Peterson

764
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,310
two researchers in the area asked the question,
该领域两位研究者提出了一个问题

765
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,390
"What is the underlying cause,or is there an underlying cause
"大多数心理问题或精神病

766
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,060
to most psychological disorders and ailments?"
根本病因是什么 或者说有没有根本病因?"

767
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,310
And what they came up with was one construct,
他们提出了一个构想

768
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,840
and that was self-esteem.
即自尊

769
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,250
Self-esteem is critical.
自尊至关重要

770
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,410
First of all in understanding,
首先 在理解层面

771
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:44,000
in understanding many of the emotional and behavioral problems;
理解各种情绪及行为问题

772
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,430
and second,in terms of most,not all,but most of the emotional
其次 治疗大多数 并不是所有

773
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,900
and behavioral problems - self-esteem at the core.
情绪及行为问题 自尊都是核心

774
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,930
Finally it doesn't just apply on the individual level,
最后 它不仅适用于个人

775
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,430
it also applies on the societal level.
还适用于社会层面

776
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,600
It was California Task Force by the government
政府成立的加州健康专责小组

777
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,380
that coined self-esteem as a social vaccine,
将自尊称为社会疫苗

778
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,390
because what they found was self-esteem was associated,
因为他们发现自尊与…

779
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,500
low self-esteem was associated with substance abuse,
低自尊与药物滥用

780
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:22,220
teen pregnancy,school drop-out rates,violence and crime.
未成年怀孕 辍学 暴力及犯罪有关

781
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:28,030
And high self-esteem: that the opposite
而高自尊恰恰相反

782
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,690
help overcome these social ailments.
能帮助克服这些社会顽疾

783
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,460
Again,not a panacea,but helps in many ways.
虽然不是万灵药 但在各个方面起到了积极作用

784
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,330
So self-esteem is good.
所以自尊是好的

785
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,660
Self-esteem in fact is great,is important.
非常重要

786
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,480
However not all is rosy in self-esteem land.
但在研究自尊这个领域里 不是所有人都意见一致的

787
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,010
And there are some criticisms,
有一些反对的声音

788
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:51,080
some criticisms by very important thinkers in the area.
有些甚至是该领域重要的思想家提出的

789
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,030
One of them,the leading one is Roy Baumeister form Florida,
其中之一是 佛罗里达州的Roy Baumeister提出的

790
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,410
equating self-esteem with arrogance and conceit.
他将自尊等同于自大自负

791
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,240
Because if you are taking a questionnaire and,of narcissism,
因为如果你进行关于自恋的问卷调查

792
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,080
those who are high on narcissism
会发现自恋程度高的人

793
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,410
will also score very high on a self-esteem measure.
自尊分也非常高

794
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,900
But here lies the problem.
但问题在这里

795
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,830
And here in the paper you are reading
你们阅读的论文

796
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,480
is how we can debunk at least this criticism - there are others.
至少可以反驳这种批评 当然还有其他的

797
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,950
You see,a person who is a narcissist,
如果一个人自恋自大

798
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,650
who is arrogant,doesn't have high self-esteem.
自尊程度其实不高

799
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,250
I mean we all know that's common sense.
这是常识

800
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,710
Someone who walks into a room immediately looking like a peacock,
一个像高傲的孔雀一样走进教室

801
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,750
showing off,bragging
摆现炫耀

802
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:40,650
does that person have high self-esteem? Probably not.
这人一定是高自尊吗 不一定

803
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,130
A person who is humble,who doesn't need constantly show off
一个谦虚不摆现的人

804
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,220
is usually the person with higher levels of self-esteem.
往往自尊程度更高

805
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,320
As Rollo May,
正如Rolly May

806
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,790
one of the founders of humanistic psychology movement says,
人本主义心理学运动创始人说过

807
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,570
"The person who feels weak becomes a bully,
"软弱的人变成恶霸

808
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,280
the inferior person a braggart;
自卑的人变成吹牛大王

809
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,150
a flexing of muscles,much talk,cockiness,
炫耀武力 夸夸其谈 骄傲自大

810
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,030
an endeavor to brazen it out,
厚颜无耻

811
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,280
are symptoms of covert anxiety in a person or a group."
都是个人或集体隐匿的焦虑症状

812
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,350
It's the exact opposite of self-esteem.
这与自尊恰恰相反

813
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,380
Unfortunately today our measures of self-esteem
可惜 如今我们评估自尊的方法

814
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,850
are through questionnaires.
都是通过问卷调查进行

815
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,370
And if you ask a narcissist,"Do you have high self-esteem",
如果你问一个自恋者 "你自尊高吗"

816
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,900
the answer will of course be yes.
回答当然是 是

817
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:24,920
However,the questionnaires are not so,
但是当今大多数

818
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,430
most of the questionnaires are not sophisticated enough today
问卷调查还没有复杂到

819
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,260
to differentiate between true self-esteem
足以区分真自尊

820
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,780
and what Nathaniel Branden calls,pseudo self-esteem,
和Nathaniel Branden所说的伪自尊

821
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,790
the pretense of self-efficacy and self-respect.
自我效能与自尊心的伪装

822
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,890
Soon we'll be able to measure that much more objectively.
不久的将来我们将能更客观的衡量它们

823
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,420
So that's for narcissism.But there are other criticisms.
这是把自尊等同自恋的批评 但是还有其他批评

824
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,240
And that is that self-esteem,
其中一个认为 自尊

825
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,510
high self-esteem leads to unrealistic evaluation
高自尊会使人过分高估自己

826
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,490
and that ultimately hurts people.
最终对人造成伤害

827
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,520
Let me read you something from Times magazine
我来读一段时代周刊的报道

828
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:07,450
a report about a certain test that was given to kids 13 year olds
这篇报道是讲全世界各国13岁孩子

829
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,920
in different countries around the world.
进行的一次测验

830
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,390
A standardized math test was given to 13 year olds
去年 6个国家的13岁孩子

831
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,640
in 6 countries last year.
做了一次标准化数学测验

832
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,490
Koreans did the best;
韩国孩子表现最好

833
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,070
Americans did the worst,coming behind Spain,Ireland,and Canada
美国孩子表现最差 排在西班牙 芬兰 加拿大之后

834
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,230
Now the bad news: besides being shown triangles and equations,
坏消息是  除了三角与等式外

835
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:37,650
the kids were shown the statement "I'm good at mathematics."
试卷上还有一道判断题"我擅长数学"

836
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,210
Americans were No.1 with an impressive 68 percent in agreement.
美国孩子居然有68%选"是" 排在第一

837
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,750
American students may not know their math
美国孩子可能不懂数学

838
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,990
but they have evidently absorbed the lessons
但显然他们对新式的自尊课程

839
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,780
of the newly fashionable self-esteem curriculum,
掌握的非常好

840
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,870
wherein kids are taught to feel good about themselves.
这些课程教会孩子们自我感觉良好

841
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,760
Wherein kids are taught to feel good about themselves
这些课程教会孩子们自我感觉良好

842
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,550
and I will add "no matter what".
我还要再加句"无论做什么"

843
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,550
Because teachers,many teachers have learned
因为很多老师

844
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,260
to just give indiscriminant praise - why?
不分青红皂白地给予赞美 为什么?

845
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,230
Because self-esteem is good,it's a social vaccine
因为自尊是好的 是社会疫苗

846
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,550
and there's a lot of research to back that up.
有很多研究支持这一点

847
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,770
And how do you enhance self-esteem? -
那如何提高自尊呢

848
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,130
By showering people with "Oh,you are terrific!
要不停跟他们说"哦 你真厉害

849
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,920
You are wonderful! You are great!"
你太棒了 你真行"

850
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,980
But that,it turns out does not help these students.
但结果显示 这对学生们并没有帮助

851
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,140
In fact,in the long run - in the short term,it feels good,
事实上 长期来看…短期内感觉良好

852
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,060
but in the long term it actually reduces their motivation to work
但长期来看反而降低了他们的学习动力

853
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,260
it makes them unrealistic;
让他们变得不切实际

854
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,650
and in the long run,
长期来看

855
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:41,880
it makes them less happy than they potentially could have been.
反而减低了他们本来可能获得的快乐

856
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,080
In fact,it boomerangs.
产生了反效果

857
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,560
Again with good intentions
所以 意图是好的

858
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,780
because they want to raise their self-esteem.
因为老师们想提高学生的自尊

859
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,330
So how do we salvage self-esteem's self-esteem?
那如何拯救自尊呢?

860
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,880
By understanding its true nature.
需要先理解它的真实性质

861
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:58,840
First of all,self-esteem is not a product of empty reinforcement
首先 自尊不是空洞的心理强化能够产生的

862
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,520
Oh you are wonderful;you are terrific;
哦 你真棒 你好厉害

863
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,650
you are great - no matter what.
你真行 不管是不是都赞扬

864
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,120
That hurts self-esteem in the long term.
长期来看还会损害自尊

865
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:12,150
Self-esteem has to be distinguished from pseudo self-esteem
自尊必须与伪自尊区分开

866
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,970
once again the pretense of self-efficacy
也就是脱离现实的

867
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,960
and self-respect without the reality.
虚假的自我效能与自我尊重

868
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,830
That's not self-esteem;
那些不是自尊

869
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,630
that's narcissism; that's detachment from reality.
那是自恋 脱离现实

870
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,700
And as we've been talking about constantly,
我们最近反复提到

871
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,600
psychological healthy is a function of connection to reality.
健康心理是要联系现实

872
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:34,200
So what is self-esteem? Self-esteem is founded in reality,
所以什么是自尊呢 自尊存在于现实中

873
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:41,290
in actual performance,in actual success,in actual practices.
存在于真实的行动 真实的成功 与真实的实践中

874
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,860
It is a product of hard work.
它是努力的产物

875
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,320
OK,do you remember the secret of success from 2 months ago?
好了 还记得2个月前我们讲到的成功的秘诀吗?

876
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,080
Optimism,belief in oneself,passion for what one is doing,
乐观 相信自己 对所做之事充满热情

877
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,510
and finally,hard work.
还有一点 努力奋斗

878
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,330
That's secret.
这就是秘诀

879
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,520
Again,someone,something we all know,
这些都是我们早就知道的

880
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,370
something that is commonsensical
都是基本常识

881
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,110
but again,common sense,in Voltaire's words,is not that common.
引用伏尔泰的话"常识不一定人皆有之"

882
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,450
Nathaniel Branden talks about 6 practices
Nathaniel Branden提出了培养自尊的

883
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,310
that are important for the cultivation of self-esteem:
6条重要实践

884
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,030
first,integrity.
首先 正直

885
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,320
That's your response paper this week
你们本周读书报告主题就是

886
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,500
to raise levels of awareness about integrity.
如何提高正直意识

887
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,920
And integrity means a match between what we say and what we do,
正直是指言行一致

888
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,710
the little things and the big things,
小事大事

889
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,180
whether it's "I'll be there at 5 minutes after 5",
无论是"我5点过5分到"

890
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,290
being there at 5 minutes after 5;
那就5点过5分到

891
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,340
saying that "I'm going to work out this week",
还是"我这周去健身"

892
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,370
and actually doing it.
那就要做到

893
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,240
Because you see,when we communicate,when we utter words,
因为我们沟通 说出每个词时

894
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,550
and we don't follow up on what we say,
如果言行不一致

895
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,200
what we are essentially communicating to ourselves:
那我们本质是在对自己说

896
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,140
what I say is not important; it doesn't matter.
我的话无关紧要 不重要

897
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,960
Whereas I maintain high levels of integrity,
反之 我保持高度正直

898
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,670
when I keep my words - again no one is perfect.
遵守诺言 当然没人是完美的

899
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,800
No one has perfect integrity as we'll talk about next time.
没人会是100%的正直 我们下次会讲到

900
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:09,600
But when I genuinely keep my word,
但是我真诚的遵守诺言

901
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,290
when I follow up on what I say,
言行一致

902
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,520
when I under-promise and over-deliver,
以低要求许诺 以高要求履诺

903
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,820
that's when I communicate to myself in action
就是以行动对自己说

904
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,120
remember,self-perception theory - in action,
还记得 自我知觉理论吗 通过行动

905
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:26,050
I communicate to myself,"My words matter; I matter."
我对自己说 "我的话很重要 我很重要"

906
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,750
So the practice of integrity.
所以要正直

907
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,890
The practice of self-awareness - know thyself.
要有自我察觉 了解你自己

908
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,070
Self-consciousness,as Branden talks about.
也就是Branden说的自我意识

909
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,540
Purposefulness,having goals,having self-concordant goals,
目的性 有目标 自我协调的目标

910
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,490
pursuing them,living a life of purpose,of calling,
努力追求 有目标有使命地生活

911
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:55,250
taking responsibility - remember once again no one is coming.
担起责任 记住 没人能帮你

912
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,860
It's up to you to make something of your lives.
只有靠你自己创造生活

913
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,000
The practice of self-acceptance.
要自我接纳

914
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,000
Permission to be human on a daily basis.
每天都要允许自己有人的天性

915
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,330
And finally,the practice of self-assertiveness:
最后 要有主见

916
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,720
to say no when it's appropriate;
该说不的时候说不

917
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,090
to say yes when that is appropriate;
该说是的时候说是

918
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,090
to stand up for what we believe in.
支持我们信仰的东西

919
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,730
These are the practices that over time cultivate self-esteem.
这些实践经年累月能培养我们的自尊

920
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,520
And they are also the product of self-esteem
它们也是自尊的产物

921
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,910
as we'll see next time,
我们下次会详细讲

922
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,660
it's a potential self-reinforcing loop.
这是个潜在的自我增强循环

923
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:36,500
So this is what self-esteem is.But there are more problems.
这就是自尊 但还有一些问题需要解答

924
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,880
There are more problems in self-esteem land.
自尊领域还有很多问题

925
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,430
Here is another important criticism.
还有一项重要的批评

926
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,750
You see,a lot of research shows that
很多研究表明

927
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,710
people with high self-esteem are more generous,
高自尊的人更慷慨

928
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,540
are more benevolent toward others.
对他人更博爱

929
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,300
They are generally good.They are nice.
总得来说他们都是好人

930
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,800
A lot research shows that.So that's wonderful,terrific.
许多研究都表明这点 这很棒 很好

931
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,360
However,
但是

932
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,820
there is also a lot of research that chose the exact opposite
还有很多研究结果恰恰相反

933
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,310
that people with high self-esteem display anti-social behavior,
高自尊的人表现出反社会行为

934
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,030
whether it's toward people they don't know,
无论是对不认识的人

935
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,900
especially toward people close to them.
尤其是对特别亲近的人

936
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,290
It's been associated with aggressive
它与攻击性不合作的行为

937
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,880
and uncooperative behavior.
有所关联

938
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,060
Levels of hostility associated with high self-esteem
一些研究显示敌意程度

939
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,920
in some studies.
也与高自尊有关

940
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,390
There are contradictory evidence - doesn't make sense.
这些证据自相矛盾 无法解释

941
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,280
What's going on in self-esteem land?
自尊到底是怎么回事

942
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:32,370
Hasn't been resolved until recently.
这个问题直到最近才弄清楚

943
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,450
Another criticism of self-esteem is what I mentioned,
对自尊的另一项批评 之前我提到过了

944
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,330
the paradox of self-esteem.
自尊的矛盾

945
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,320
You see,the praise that I received as a senior here
我在大四时 在哈佛求学期间

946
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,760
or as a student here in general was,
受到的表扬

947
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,790
the praise was based on reality.
基本上是基于事实的

948
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,450
You know I did well in squash - I got praise for that;
我壁球打得很好 得到了赞扬

949
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,750
I did well academically - I got praise for that.
学术成就优异 得到了表扬

950
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,400
So it was real; it was grounded in reality
所以都是真实的 基于现实的

951
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,100
and yet I still felt like I had low self-esteem.
但是我还是觉得自尊很低

952
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,890
In fact,the more praise I got,
事实上 我获得的赞扬越多

953
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,780
in many ways I felt the rock became heavier
越觉得石块越重

954
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,550
and  the mountain steeper.
山坡越陡

955
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,450
And that is not explained by traditional self-esteem research.
这点传统的自尊研究无法解释

956
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,810
Bednar and Peterson talk about,they talk about this paradox.
Bednar和Peterson谈到了这个矛盾

957
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,930
And they give examples in their book - this is the first place
他们在书中举了例子 这是我第一次看到

958
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,870
where I found someone talking about something
有人谈论

959
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,700
that I experienced for many years.
我这么多年的经历

960
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,730
They talked about the paradox where very often success
他们谈到了成功往往

961
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,550
is associated with low levels of self-esteem.
与低自尊共存的矛盾

962
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,360
So let me read to you an account of a client that they had
我读一段他们一位病人写的话

963
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,710
they are therapists - who has been very successful.
他俩都是心理医生 非常成功

964
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,000
And here he is,writing his journal:
他在日记中这样写道

965
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:57,310
"For the past several years,I felt that my life was meaningless.
"过去几年 我觉得生活毫无意义

966
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,760
This was an ironic state of affairs
这种状态非常讽刺

967
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,060
considering all I had accomplished.
因为我事业有成

968
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,220
Friends and relatives were always lauding me
亲朋好友总是赞美

969
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,340
for my good looks and intelligence.
我的外表与智慧

970
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,310
I was the first person on either side of my family
父母双方家中 我都是第一个

971
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,850
to graduate from college,
大学毕业生

972
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,630
doing so with honors.
而且是优秀荣誉毕业生

973
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,440
I had a good job with an important accounting firm.
我在大型会计事务所有一份好工作

974
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,360
I had plenty of dates.
不缺女伴

975
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,760
By all outward appearances,my life was very fulfilling.
表面看上去 我的生活非常满足

976
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,970
Yet I was miserable and felt increasingly depressed.
但我仍旧感到痛苦 日益沮丧

977
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,820
Six months of psychotherapy had helped me
6个月的心理疗法帮助我

978
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,600
to catch an occasional glimpse
瞥见了

979
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,190
of the underlying cause of my unhappiness.
我不快乐的潜在原因

980
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:38,610
It always seemed to involve low self-esteem
似乎与我的低自尊

981
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,820
or my disapproval of myself.
或自我否定有关

982
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:46,240
Somehow it seems like I really did have a low opinion of myself,
不知怎么 我似乎对自己评价很低

983
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,950
but I found that idea confusing,
这点让我很困惑

984
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,550
because of all the success in my life."
因为我生活很成功"

985
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,600
Bednar and Peterson talked,talk about,
Bednar与Peterson谈到了

986
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,900
or introduce there the paradox of self-esteem.
自尊的矛盾

987
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,610
That's what they call it.
这是他们的叫法

988
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,130
Self-esteem is not associated with success;
自尊与成功没有关系

989
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,970
it's not associated with social status,with money;
与社会地位 金钱没有关系

990
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,010
it's associated with other elements.
而是与其他因素有关

991
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,260
In fact,as the paradox shows very often,
事实上 这一矛盾经常显示

992
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,730
more success leads to more difficulty in this realm.
越成功遇到的困难越多

993
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,530
It was this difficulty that
我希望对这种困难进行研究

994
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,560
I wanted to explore and explored in my research.
并且的确进行了研究

995
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,930
And this is the formulation that I introduced.
这就是我之前谈到的公式

996
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:37,750
The first level of self-esteem was a dependent self-esteem,
第一层自尊 是依赖型自尊

997
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,970
because what I felt was that self-esteem was a construct,
因为我觉得自尊是一个构想

998
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,960
was not enough,was not enough.
这还不够

999
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,320
The contractions there were plenty;
还有各种矛盾

1000
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,280
the paradox there was not explained by the notion of self-esteem.
还有自尊无法解释矛盾

1001
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,470
So I divided self-esteem into three parts
所以我把自尊分为了三个部分

1002
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,990
based on the work of Lovinger
根据Lovinger的理论

1003
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:59,400
she did her work back in the 60s,based on the work of Maslow,
1960年代 她的研究是建立在Maslow

1004
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,180
based on the work of Carl Rogers and Nathaniel Branden
Carl Rogers以及Nathaniel Branden理论的基础上的

1005
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,410
who had talked about these things.
他们都谈到了这些问题

1006
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,090
But again,we are not in the majority;
但是我们仍是小众

1007
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,100
most people who talked about self-esteem talked about it
大多数人讲到自尊时

1008
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,810
as a single construct.
仍把它当做独立的概念

1009
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,800
The second component:
第二层自尊

1010
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,380
self-esteem that is not contingent on others;
不取决于其他因素的自尊

1011
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,540
and finally the third component essentially
第三层自尊 本质上

1012
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,070
does not even need to be called self-esteem
甚至不必把它称为自尊

1013
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,490
simply a sense of self.
而是一种自我感

1014
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,410
Let me begin with each one,describing each one.
让我一个个来细说

1015
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,730
And what I'll do in describing each one
我分析每层自尊时

1016
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,770
is talk about the two components of self-esteem.
会从自尊的两个组成部分去讲

1017
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,030
So essentially what I'll create is a three by two:
所以本质上是建立了一个2x3列联表

1018
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,190
the three types of self-esteem,
三层自尊

1019
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:47,010

每一层与价值感 或者说自我尊重的关系

1020
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,080
and how it relates to competence

1021
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,280
the two components of Nathaniel Branden's work.
Nathaniel Branden理论里 自尊的两个组成部分

1022
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,630
So first of all,
首先

1023
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,290
in terms of worthiness - in terms of worthiness a person
从价值感方面来看

1024
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,370
who has high dependent self-esteem is other determined.
高依赖型自尊的人 价值由他人决定

1025
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,610
They enjoy and they need the appraisal.
他们喜欢 也需要别人的评估

1026
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,490
If I do well in a lecture,
如果我讲座表现不错

1027
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,220
and I get an external feedback that makes me great;

1028
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,230
if I don't get great feedback,I feel awful.

Constant evaluation - what do other people think of me?

1036
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,900

looking at other people as it reflects on me

01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:52,800
and taking their evaluation as the sense of self that I have.

1057
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,890
what matters is how I am doing relative to others.

1058
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,210
William James captured this.
William James抓住了这一点

01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,460
He said,"I,who have staked my all in psychology,

am   when others know more psychology than I."

1062
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,310

01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,680
as dependent self-esteem.

1064
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,190
The work of Cooley,talking about the looking glass metaphor;

1065
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,110
the work of Mead's,back in 1934,

talking about dependent self-esteem

1068
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:32,510
or what we perceive they think or say about us.

Most of the thinkers have talked about it.
大多数思想家都谈到了这点

1070
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,060
This is best captured;
这点形象地在童话中展示出来了

1071
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,210
this is what I thought about for the first time in Fairy Tales.
我第一次上童话课时就想到了

1072
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:43,300
This is best captured by the evil Queen:
白雪公主里的邪恶皇后生动的表现了这点

1073
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,150
"Mirror,mirror on the wall,who is the fairest of them all?"
"魔镜魔镜告诉我 谁是世界上最美的女人"

1074
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,730
And as long as the mirror says,
只要魔镜说

1075
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,970
"You,my Queen,you are the fairest of them all," she feels great
"你 皇后陛下 你是世界上最美的女人" 她就觉得心满意足

1076
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,690
As soon as there is one person who is more fair than thee,
一旦有人比她更漂亮

1077
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:02,200
immediately she's mortified.
她就觉得蒙受奇耻大辱

1078
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,140
The two components of self-esteem here:
说明了这种自尊的两个特点

1079
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,130
first of all,the other determined.
首先 由他人决定

1080
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,560
I'm asking a mirror to evaluate me,not self-determined.
我问镜子谁漂亮 而不是由我自己决定

1081
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,490
So my worthiness comes from an external source.
所以我的价值感来源于外部

1082
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,650
And second,competence - I compare myself to others.
第二 通过比较而获得能力感

1083
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,800
Is there anyone who is fairer than I? Dependent self-esteem.
有人比我更美吗 依赖型自尊

1084
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:29,000
Now I've quite literally now caricatured dependent self-esteem.
现在我似乎把依赖型自尊贬得一无是处

1085
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,170
Let me make this very clear.
让我再说的清楚点

1086
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,880
Everyone has some dependent self-esteem.
每个人都有依赖型自尊

1087
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:39,020
There is no person that I've met or have heard of,
我从未遇见或听说任何人

1088
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,780
who is oblivious to what other people think or say,
能完全不受他人想法言论

1089
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,910
or to social comparisons.
或社会比较的的干扰

1090
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,820
It's part of human nature.
这是人的天性的一部分

1091
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,050
Nature to be commanded must be obeyed.
要支配天性 就必须服从天性

1092
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,370
If we fight it,it will only intensify,
反抗天性 只会让其加剧

1093
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,430
as we've seen numerous examples throughout this semester.
这学期我们已经看到过很多这方面的例子了

1094
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,040
Permission to be human
允许自己有人的缺点

1095
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,270
and part of being human is that we all have some dependent self...
依赖型自尊也是人性的一部分

1096
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,610
The question is of degree.
问题在于程度

1097
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,830
The important thing to understand about this model,
理解这个模型的一个关键是

1098
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,720
these three levels is that it's an epigenetic model.
这三个层面是一个渐成模型

1099
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,930
It is an epigenetic model.
渐成模型

1100
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:17,340
And I've no idea what that means.No.
我也不知道这是什么意思

1101
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:24,110
Epigenetic is that you first need to get past the first stage
渐成是指必须通过第一阶段

1102
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,780
in order to get to the second stage;
才能到达第二阶段

1103
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,570
you first need to get past the second stage
必须通过第二阶段

1104
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,290
in order to get to the third stage;
才能到达第三阶段

1105
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,930
that you cannot skip,for example,
不能越过某一级 比如

1106
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:35,310
from stage 1 to stage 3 without going through 2.
从第一阶段直接到第三阶段 跳过了第二阶段

1107
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,730
So everyone experiences dependent self-esteem always.
所以每个人都有依赖型自尊

1108
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:44,650
However,after a time if we have a healthy dependence,
但是 如果我们有健康的依赖型自尊

1109
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,350
which is natural,which we all have at an earlier age,
这很自然 我们小时候都经历过

1110
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,880
later on it becomes independent.
一段时间后就会变成独立型自尊

1111
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,900
And if we are able to cultivate a healthy independent self-esteem
如果我们能培养健康的独立型自尊

1112
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,050
we go up to the unconditional self-esteem,
就能达到无条件自尊

1113
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,880
to the state of inter-dependence,which is the highest level.
达到互相依赖型 也就是最高层次

1114
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:07,100
But even at the highest level,we still have reminisce.
但是即使在最高层次 其他两种还是存在的

1115
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,260
And we will always have elements of the dependent
我们会一直拥有依赖型

1116
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,180
as well as the independent sense of self.
及独立型自我感

1117
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,060
When I started doing my research initially,
研究一开始时

1118
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,140
I said,I depicted independent versus dependent
我想把独立型与依赖型对比

1119
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:23,490
I hadn't thought of unconditional at the time
我当时还没有想到无条件型

1120
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,320
as independent good,dependent bad.
想当然地认为独立型好 依赖型坏

1121
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,170
And I tried to get rid of the dependent self.
我试图摆脱依赖型自我

1122
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,960
And what happened - it just simply intensified.
结果它反而强化了

1123
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,370
It simply got stronger.
变得更强烈

1124
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,630
And I became even more dependent;
我变得更加依赖

1125
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,040
whereas as soon as I started to accept it
然而 一旦我开始接受它

1126
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:42,370
remember,I talked about it,permission to be human
记住吗 我说过 允许自己有人的天性

1127
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,900
as soon as I accepted it as part of human nature,
一旦我接受它为人性的一部分

1128
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:49,060
it actually lost much of its power over me.
对我的影响反而小多了

1129
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:53,920
Still there as it is for everyone,but the question is of degree.
人人都有依赖型自尊 只是程度不同

1130
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:00,640
The second level self-esteem,independent self-esteem.
第二个层面是独立型自尊

1131
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:01,890
As its name suggests,
顾名思义

1132
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,180
that self-esteem - that's not contingent on other people.
这种自尊不取决于他人

1133
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,930
So in terms of worthiness,
在价值感方面

1134
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,540
I evaluate myself according to my own standards.
我用自己的标准评估自己

1135
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:11,750

I determine how good a book that I wrote is.

and listen to what other people are saying;

1139
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,330
but at the end of the day I'm the one who decides.
但是最终还是由我自己说了算

1140
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:33,360
Competence,not comparison to others but comparison to oneself.
在能力感方面 不与别人比较 而是与自己比较

1141
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:36,830
Have I improved? Am I better writer today than I was in the past?

1146
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,880
Not compared to my roommate
不与室友比较

1147
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,750
who is applying so much more or so much less,
无论他懂的比我多还是少

1148
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,660
but mostly focused on the self.
我只关注自己

1149
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:02,280
Once again,people who wrote about this type of self-esteem:
很多人都提到了这种自尊

1150
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:06,660
Nathaniel Branden,Abraham Maslow,Carl Rogers,

In fact that person constantly looks for "beautiful enemies",

Their motivation,their primary motivation is

from a lower sense of self-esteem that is contingent on others.

1184
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,620
To summarize,initially the first two by two:

dependent self-esteem - worthiness,determined by others.

01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,770
And that determines my self-esteem.

01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:26,810
In terms of my worthiness,in terms of independent self-esteem,

1191
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,760
I compare myself to myself - have I improved;

And my worthiness is determined by my own evaluation.

1194
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,540
Third level,unconditional self-esteem.
第三个层次 无条件自尊

1195
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,660
In many ways,this is not even self-esteem.
从多个角度看 这甚至不算是自尊

1196
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:48,600
Because there is no esteeming involved here.

1197
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:53,520
The first component,worthiness,not contingent
第一部分 价值感

1198
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,200
it's not contingent on other people's evaluations;

01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,420
it's not even contingent on my evaluation.

I'm confident enough not to be engaged in evaluations.

1201
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:10,700
In terms of competence,it's interdependent.
其次是能力感 互相依赖

1202
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,030
I don't compare myself to how well I am doing relative to others,

Interdependence with others - fully comfortable in my own skin.
与他人互相依赖 同时又怡然自得

1206
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,970
For example,
比如

a person writing a book who has high dependent self-esteem

a person with independent self-esteem writes a book

还有对书的自我评价 这本书写得真好

1216
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:07,320
A person who has unconditional self-esteem simply writes a book.
而无条件型自尊的人只是写书

1217
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,090
Why? Because he or she once,
为什么? 因为一旦他们

1218
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,170
if they have a good idea,a good book to be out there,
有灵感 就会写出一本好书

1219

they derive as much satisfaction,
他们从他人的好书中

1220

as much pleasure when they see another person's book,who is good

01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,290
They see themselves as one with others.

01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,750
and some components of unconditional self-esteem.
以及一定程度的无条件自尊

1226
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,740
The question is of degree.The model is epigenetic.
问题在于程度 模型是渐成型的

1227
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,550
It takes a lifetime very often
通常需要一辈子时间

1228
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,760
to cultivate more and more of the unconditional self.
把无条件自我培养得越来越强

1229
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:52,820
Now one of the criticism is that I face
我和其他赞同无条件自尊的学者

1230
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,320
and other writes who have written about unconditional self-esteem
受到的批评之一是

1231
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:04,290
is that to be at this stage of "Well,I don't really care or
要达到这种状态 "我不在乎

1232
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:09,480
don't care that much about whether I get criticism or evaluation"
不是很在乎我受到批评还是评价"

1233
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:14,990
is that one becomes detached from others,that one does not care.
就会变得与他人脱离了 对什么都不在乎

1234
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:16,330
But that is not the case.
但情况不是这样

1235
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:16,840
You see,
瞧

1236
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,150
there are many parallels between unconditional self-esteem
无条件自尊与佛教的超然

1237
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:24,790
and the Buddhist conception of detachment.
有许多相似处

1238
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,930
Let me read to you something.
我给你们读一段

1239
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,550
This was written by the Buddhist nun,Thubten Chodron,
图丹却准法师的语录

1240
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,560
and I quote: "Ordinarily,
"通常

1241
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:37,030
we become very upset when we are criticized or insulted.
我们受到批评或侮辱时 会变得非常不安

1242
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,630
We are angry when our possessions are stolen;
我们财产被偷时 会变得异常愤怒

1243
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,010
we are jealous if someone else gets the promotion we wanted;
如果期望已久的升职被别人抢去 我们会嫉妒

1244
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,270
we are proud of our looks or athletic ability.
我们以自己的外表体能为荣

1245
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,750
By contrast,when we reach the state of detachment,
相比之下 当我们达到了超然的境界

1246
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,210
our mind becomes clearer
我们的头脑变得更明晰

1247
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,020
and more capable of enjoying things for what they are.
懂的享受事物的原本

1248
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:59,490
We live more in the present,appreciating things as they are now,

1249
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,610
without fantasies about what they are or will be.

01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,060
to every action other people do in relation to us."
不再那么敏感"

1252
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:13,280
Now at the same time,detachment or unconditional self-esteem
同时 超然或无条件自尊

1253
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,680
which is the parallel that I'm drawing,
我正比较两者的相似点

1254
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,810
does not mean being indifferent
它们并不意味着冷漠

1255
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,230
or rejecting other people's feelings.
回避他人情感

1256
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:24,540
She continues,"On the contrary,when we are not attached,
她继续说"相反地 当我们超然后

1257
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,450
our relationships with others are harmonious,

1258
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:31,110
and in fact,we care more about them.

1259
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:35,500
We become more compassionate,more empathetic toward others."
变得更有同情心 更同情他人"

1260
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:42,400
Detachment or unconditional self-esteem simply means that
超然或无条件自尊只是指

1261
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,260
we are distancing ourselves
我们让自己远离

1262
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,610
or not experiencing as much feelings of jealousy,
羡慕嫉妒

1263
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:52,450
feelings of envy,constant superiority or inferiority,
高傲自卑

1264
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,130
ongoing comparison to others.
与他人对比的情绪

1265
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,880
It means,on many levels,that we are one with them.

1266
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:04,010
This is what the research shows.
这就是研究结果

1267
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,140
You know,in fact,you can think about
事实上 你可以把无条件自尊

1268
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:10,830
unconditional self-esteem as parallel to going to a movie.
比作看电影

1269
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:14,310
When you are going to a movie,what happens?
你去电影院 然后呢

1270
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:17,040
You are empathizing with the characters there.
你与角色产生了共鸣

1271
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,440

you experience a hard time viscerally;

You are one with them.

1275
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:33,330
Why? Because your ego is not threatened

1276
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,800
you are not threatened by their success;

1277
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,560
their good looks are not threatening to you;

their successes are not a threat to you.

1279
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:44,650
Why? Because it's just a movie.
为什么? 因为这只是电影

1280
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,930
Now imagine: if we could have these emotions,

This is the experience,again of a movie,

1285
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:06,090
but so much more powerful because it's real
但对拥有高无条件自尊的人来说

1286
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,070
of a person who has high levels of unconditional self-esteem.
会有多强大

1287
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,780
Cultivating self-esteem,unconditional self-esteem takes time.
培养自尊 无条件自尊需要时间

1288
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,530
It's a lifelong process.

1289
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,190
In many ways,it's parallel to learning how to walk.

What happens when we learn how to walk? Initially we can't.

After a while we are able to get up,but we need some help;

We are able to walk by ourselves.

1296
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:47,630
But we walk still by thinking about picking up this foot
但走的时候仍旧要想着抬脚

1297
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:48,810
and we are precarious.
而且觉得不安全

1298
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,210

Later on we simply and naturally walk.

We don't need to think about it constantly.
