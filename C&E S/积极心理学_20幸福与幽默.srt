She laughed and she scrambled back on the bunk bed

that lens of something like optimism or mindfulness.

So too I think humor is exactly in this the facet.

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,240
or viewing the world

through the lens of something of adaptive and powerful.

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,290
So I defined humor today as a mindful lens,

through which we can view the world

about why we are doing this in the first place.

I assume he meant because of the Passover.

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,210
that is occurring in the scholar journals.
17比1 或者21比1

291
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,280
Last night when I supposed to be writing this talk,
昨晚我写这节课的讲义时

292
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,160
I looked on the e-resources and
我在eResources上查东西

293
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,700
found that there's a 97 to 3 ratio of negative to humor research.
我发现消极研究与幽默研究的比例是97比3

294
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,060
For example,depression was 125,000 articles,
例如 研究抑郁症的有125000篇文章

295
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,870
while humor was only 4,943 articles.
而研究幽默的只有4943篇

296
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,160
Nothing came up for "Steven Colbert".
搜索Steven Colbert时 结果为零

297
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,970
But the reason why that this is important
这其中有一个重要原因

298
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,630
is because of something called Medical School Syndrome.
因为一种叫医学院症候群的现象

299
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,060
We know that
我们知道

300
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,340
the way we study absolutely has effects upon our body.
我们的学习对我们的身体是绝对有影响的

301
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,250
So if you know that the Medical School Syndrome,
所以如果你知道医学院症候群

302
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,520
you'll know that
你就会知道

303
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,140
as doctors are learning about all the different diseases
当医生对世界上各种疾病的知识

304
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,470
that are out there in the world,
越来越丰富时

305
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,650
suddenly they realize they have all of them.
他们会突然发现 自己好像什么病都患上了

306
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,860
And my brother in law called me from medical school
我妹夫从医学院打电话给我

307
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,540
and said,"Shawn," C my brother in law's name is Bobo.
他说"Shawn" 我妹夫名字叫Bobo

308
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,960
That's another story.
这是题外话了

309
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,110
Bobo called me from medical school,
Bobo从医学院打电话给我

310
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,210
and said,"Shawn I have leprosy."
他说"Shawn 我患麻风了"

311
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,280
And I had no idea how to console him
我不知道怎么安慰他

312
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,670
because he just got over a menopause.
因为他刚刚才过完更年期

313
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,090
The way we study the world around us actually changes the lens
我们研究世界的视角 真的能改变

314
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,590
through which we view the world.
我们看待世界的视角

315
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,630
And if we are not studying humor,
如果我们不研究幽默

316
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,740
we are missing out one of the major aspects
我们就不会了解社会互动的

317
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,710
of social interactions,
一个重大方面

318
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,500
but also the way that the world works.
也无法了解世界是怎么运行的

319
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,200
So why don't we talk about humor more often?
那为什么我们对幽默的研究这么少?

320
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,950
First of all,humor is extremely difficult to define.
首先 幽默是非常难定义的

321
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,880
Every time you are tempted to define humor,
每次你想定义幽默

322
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,800
it seems to slip through your fingers.
它就从你的指间溜走

323
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,830
Every time you try... Everyone finds something else funny,right?
每次你想…大家觉得好笑的东西都不一样

324
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,140
What I wanted to show for videos today,
例如我今天想放的视频

325
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
you might not find funny at all.
你们可能会觉得一点都不好笑

326
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,230
And what you find funny is objectively not funny at all.
你们觉得好笑的地方 客观来说一点都不好笑

327
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,050
I tried to show my parents Superbad
我想让我父母看"太坏了"

328
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,720
cause I thought that was funny.
因为我觉得那部电影很好笑

329
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,300
And if they are laughing on the inside,
但就算他们心里觉得好笑

330
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,550
they certainly weren't showing on the outside.
他们也不会笑出来

331
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,430
Part of what we were doing C
一部分是…

332
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,580
you know some people laugh at things serious
有些人听到严肃的事会笑

333
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,700
that are supposed to be serious,like Gossip Girl.
或者说本应该很严肃的事 例如"绯闻女孩"

334
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,990
And then people on the Kirkland -
Kirkland宿舍的人

335
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,860
Kirkland girl have to throw pillows at them
kirkland宿舍的女同学 要用枕头打她们

336
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,870
and threaten to ad-board them just so I don't miss anything.
威胁把她们登在广告栏上 才能让她们笑出来

337
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:15,820
So why I talk about... So part of it is the definitional problems.
所以我为什么说…研究幽默的难点之一就是定义

338
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,370
It's so difficult for us actually define what humor is,
我们很难定义幽默是什么

339
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,220
because the moment you begin to define it,
因为当你一定义它

340
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,220
it seems to slip through fingers.
它就从指间溜走了

341
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,410
The moment you are tempted to explain to somebody,
当你想向别人解释

342
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,730
explain to your e-harmony date
向你交友网eHarmony上的对象解释

343
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,900
why you are much funnier than they think you are,

344
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:28,860
you already know
你就知道

345
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,350
you've gone down the wrong path for a lot of different reasons.
不管怎样看 你都走错方向了

346
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,090
But part of what we are seeing here is that
我们从中发现

347
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,730
once we are tempted to define something,
一旦我们试图去定义某些东西

348
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,670
once we attempt to define what makes something humorous,
一旦我们试图定义是什么让一些事情变得幽默时

349
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,370
it immediately seems to go away.
这些事情马上就不幽默了

350
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,230
This is the Dead Frog Problem.
这是一个死青蛙问题

351
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,020
The Dead Frog Problem is that
死青蛙问题就是说

352
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,400
the more you seem to dissect the frog,the faster it seems to die
你越是解剖一只青蛙 它死得就越快

353
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,480
The same is true with a joke.
笑话也如此

354
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,010
And as a result of this,
因此

355
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,300
that makes it very difficult for us to study it.
这使得幽默很难研究

356
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,670
But let's say even if we could study it.
即使我们能研究它

357
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,960
Let's say we could study it.
假设我们能研究它

358
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,630
We know it has physical and social benefits.
我们知道它对我们的身体和社交有益处

359
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,090
That doesn't do us a world of good
但如果有些人天生就是幽默的

360
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,680
if people are just naturally funny
有些人天生就是不幽默的

361
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,620
and some people are unnaturally funny.
就算研究它也帮不了我们什么

362
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,900
If you are just genetically funny,if you are born funny,
如果你天生就幽默

363
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,280
and we all think that there are certain people that are like that
我们认为确实有些人是天生幽默的

364
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,780
if you think that some people are born funny,
如果你认为幽默是天生的

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,820
that doesn't do us any good to talk about the benefits
这样就知道它有什么益处 对我们也没什么帮助

366
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,520
that none of us can access.
因为我们都得不到这些益处

367
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,090
It's the same way with positive psychology,right?
这跟幸福心理是一样的道理 对吧?

368
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,390
It's the same problem we have with positive and happy
在研究积极 幸福

369
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,040
and optimistic people C they are just annoying.
乐观的人是 也有同样的问题 他们太莫名其妙了

370
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,550
But part of what we are seeing is,
但我们可以看到

371
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,510
that part of our worry is that while we are studying this,
我们研究幸福心理的一个担心是

372
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,500
if happiness,positivity and optimism are all based upon genetics
如果幸福 积极 和乐观都是由基因决定的

373
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,220
then there's no point of studying any of the things
那么研究我们在这个班上所讲的内容

374
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,690
we've been talking about so far in this class.
还有什么意义?

375
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,870
The same is true with humor.
幽默也是如此

376
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,160
If we can't access any of those benefits,
如果我们得不到这些益处

377
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,450
that just gives the funny people more to laugh at us about.
只会给幽默的人更多理由来嘲笑我们

378
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,520
So I think we can overcome all the barriers today.
我想我们今天能克服所有这些障碍

379
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,150
And I think there are some extraordinary research
我知道幸福心理领域已经出版了

380
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,650
that has been coming out in positive psychology
一些非常棒的研究

381
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,500
and research specifically on humor
还有专门研究幽默的研究

382
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,010
that's actually going to allow us
这些研究能让我们

383
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,340
to be able to look at this human phenomena in a way
用全新的角度来研究幽默这个人类现象

384
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,060
that actually is gonna help us in a lot of different ways.
并且给我们带来各种各样的益处

385
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,690
So let me tell you that there is actually -
所以我想告诉大家 我们有…

386
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,920
in order to study this just as we did with positive psychology,
为了让我们能够像研究幸福心理一样研究幽默

387
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,740
we are going to have to look at
我们要看看

388
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,360
where we looked at the humanist tradition of psychology.
心理学的人文传统

389
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,250
So too we are going to ground ourselves
所以我们要立足于

390
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,050
in the philosophies of humor.
幽默的哲学

391
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,490
We are gonna have to understand the giants of humor.
我们会讲到研究幽默的三大巨人

392
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,260
And we are gonna look at two of the theories
我们还会讲两个理论

393
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,710
which I don't find one of them more compelling than the other.
我觉得这两个理论 没有什么高低之分

394
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,550
What I find really compelling is my explanation
真正高明的是我的解释

395
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,450
which I shall be giving afterwards.
我稍后就会讲给大家听

396
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,780
So basically there are three giants
这三大巨人

397
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,600
in the field of psychological research on humor-
研究幽默这个心理学领域的三大巨人

398
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,600
Sigmund Freud,Henri Bergson,and me.
就是弗洛伊德 伯格森 和我

399
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,880
And so we'll first talk about Sigmund Freud.
我们先来讲弗洛伊德

400
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
Sigmund Freud whose surely unassailable logical assumptions on
弗洛伊德他在很多课题上 都作出过无懈可击的

401
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,460
the whole host of topics will absolutely stand the test of time.
符合逻辑的假设 而且这些假设都将经受得起时间的考验

402
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,680
Wrote a book called Jokes
他写了一本书叫

403
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,710
and Their Relationship to the Unconscious.
《笑话及其与潜意识的关系》

404
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,390
Jokes and Their Relationship to the Unconscious -
《笑话及其与潜意识的关系》

405
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,120
if you haven't read it - is for a guy writing a book about humor,
如果你还没有看过 对于写一本关于幽默的书的人来说

406
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,220
this is the most unfunny collection of stories since Leviticus.
这本书是自《利末记》以来最不好笑的笑话集

407
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,450
And in this book he describes this model consciousness
在这本书里 他描述了一种典范意识

408
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,540
while the inside you have the id - the id contains the sexual
在我们内心有一个本我 这个本我包括了大家都有的

409
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,300
and the physical and the violent impulses that we all have.
性欲 生命力 和冲动

410
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,720
I don't have,cause I went to the Divinity School,
我没有 因为我读过神学院

411
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,230
but you all have.
但你们都有

412
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,100
Outside of that is the ego which makes the decisions about the id
本我之外 是自我 这个自我会把本我视为

413
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,330
as the permeable barrier between the id impulses and the society.
本我冲动和社会之间一道可渗透的屏障

414
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,920
And the outside layer is super-ego.
最外面的是超我

415
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,220
The super-ego is the moral constraints,
超我是加在我们身上的

416
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,610
the societal constraints that is placed upon us.
道德约束和社会约束

417
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,170
So for example,if my id impulse make,
例如 如果我的本我冲动

418
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,570
means that I'm angry at you,and I want to punch you,
说我很生气 我想揍你

419
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,880
my super-ego,the constraints of society prevent me from doing so
我的超我 那个道德约束就会阻止我打你

420
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,720
And in the same way if I was wanting to have sex with somebody
同样 如果我想和某个人上床

421
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,700
and my super-ego said that it was not OK.
我的超我说这样不行

422
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
The super-ego,
超我

423
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,420
the moral constraints of society would prevent me from having sex
这个社会道德约束会阻止我和别人上床

424
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,400
That's probably the only thing keeping me from having sex.
这可能是唯一能阻止我上床的东西了

425
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,340
It's my super-ego.
我的超我

426
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,750
And so one of the things that we find
我们发现

427
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,290
is that Freud argues we get frustrated.
弗洛伊德说的是 我们都会受挫

428
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,130
We get frustrated because those id impulses are there
我们都会受挫 因为我们都有本我冲动

429
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,120
but we have no way of getting those impulses out into the world.
但我们没办法把这些冲动释放出来

430
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,700
And so we become repressed.
所以我们就会被压抑

431
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,100
And more you become repressed,
你越压抑

432
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,780
I think something's about exploding in the end.
最终就会爆发

433
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,700
So there's something that's really bad about that.
所以压抑会带来严重后果

434
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,460
So what he says is that humor is a socially acceptable envelope
他认为 幽默是一种社会可接受的

435
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,870
for couching those id desires.

436
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,390
It's a way,a socially acceptable way
这是一种社会可接受的

437
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,680
of getting those id impulses out into society,which explains
把本我冲动释放出来的方法 这就解释了

438
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,370
why so much of our humor is sexual or aggressive in nature.
为什么我们很多幽默 本质上都是与性和攻击有关的

439
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,990
There's a lot of different examples that we can talk about this-
我们可以举很多例子来说明

440
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,500
that humor as a psychological safety vault,
把幽默视为一个心理保险库

441
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,100
is one of the ways which explains
这就解释了

442
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,260
why you have sexual innuendo jokes on the first date,right?
为什么你们会在首次约会时说一些隐晦的黄段子 对吧?

443

Before physicality might be socially acceptable,
在我们的体格特征得到社会接受前

444
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,800
which also explains Michael Scott from the Office -

"that's what she said" jokes,

where he says "that's what she said" to everything.

While some of them are pretty hard to understand,and slippery,

and hard to grasp,they always left me smiling and satisfied.
很难领会 但我每次听到都笑而不语 心满意足

449
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,940
So this also explains humor we have toward political figures.
这也解释了我们为什么喜欢拿政治人物来开玩笑

450
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,300
A lot of time when political figures were not able to,

451
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,550
we have no recourse at the sexual aggressive level

452
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,600
to vent our frustration.
来发泄这种挫折感

453
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,090
So humor is actually one of the ways we can get that out there.

454
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,500
The humor itself using words is the way that
通过语言上的幽默

455
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,760
we can allow for id impulses to come out.
我们能够允许冲动释放出来

456
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,660
Because those words

don't violate very many of our social constructions.

We'll talk about that in a moment -

one of the flaws with Freud theory.

But supposedly the words don't actually harm us.

social scripts that are surrounding us all the time.

And because of that,they were able to enjoy the experience

and actually cause other people more suffering.

683
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,840
Part of what we are seeing here is that -
我们从中发现

684
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,180
absolutely is the mindset that

685
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,230
dictates whether or not something is going to be funny.

And today we are going to talk about some of the ways
今天我们就讲几个

688
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,240
you can actually control that.
控制这个心态的方法

689
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,360
But one of the things that we talked about earlier
我们这个学期之前讲过

690
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,210
in this semester was Wiseman's study on the luck factor.
Wiseman对幸运配方的研究

691
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,830
Remember the luck factor was
大家回忆一下 幸运配方是指

692
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,210
where he studied and actually created the luck school,

693
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,980
in which you can teach people how to feel more lucky,

694
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,660
and how you can give people the same exact scenario

695
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,060
where some people would feel lucky,
有些人会觉得幸运

696
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,180
or some people would feel unlucky.
有些人会觉得不幸

697
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,500
So for example,if you walk into a bank,
例如 如果你走进一间银行

698
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,000
and you are there with a hundred people -

699
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,370
actually let's say that we are here in -

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,400
we are not in Annenberg - we are here in Sanders.

701
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,810
And somebody walks in with a gun

and fires his weapon one time and shoots me right in the arm.

Do I consider this to be a lucky event or an unlucky event?

704
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,740
Well according to Wiseman,
根据Wiseman所说

705
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,130
that depends upon the counterfactual I used to determine this.
这取决于我用什么反事实去看待这件事了

706
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,220
If I compare to every other time
如果我拿这件事跟

707
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,120
that I have been here and in the theater,
我平时进戏院的情况相比

708
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,790
that seems to be a pretty unlucky event,right?
那这件事肯定是倒霉了 对吧?

709
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,330
And it seems to be pretty unfortunate.
这样看 非常不幸

710
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,290
I mean there's a lot of other people in the room

711
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,770
that this person can shoot.

00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,180
I went to the Divinity School.

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,890
I'm sure I'm better than at least one of the other people in here
我肯定比这个房间里至少一个人要好

714
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,830
and deserve this less.
肯定至少有一个人比我更活该中枪

715
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,750
So why was I the one that got shot?
可为什么偏偏打中我?

716
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,430
On the other hand,
但从另一方面看

717
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,060
the counter fact that I could use to compare to see
我可以用另一个反事实去跟这件事比较

718
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,500
if this is actually a lucky or not lucky event,that
看看这件事是走运还是倒霉

719
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,910
counter fact could be "well he could have shot me in the head."
这个反事实可以是"他有可能打中我的头"

720
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,470
Now I know I love that the optimistic
我喜欢这个乐观

721
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,600
and lucky view point as I always choose things
幸运的观点 因为我总是选择

722
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,640
that cause the most carnage and blood,right?
能造成最多伤害和流血的反事实 对吧?

723
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,600
Or I could've got shot in the head and the heart
或者说 我有可能被打中头部和心脏

724
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,480
and died upon stage bleeding to death.
流血过多而死

725
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,030
That would be - I'm definitely killing the mood.
这样…我坏了大家的心情了

726
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,780
This is just like every day.
每天都这样子

727
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,580
So it usually happens about 20 minutes in.
通常都是上课20分钟就这样

728
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:02,650
So based upon the way that I actually decide to counter a fact

729
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,820
to that determine whether or not I find something be funny.
来决定我觉得什么好笑 什么不好笑

730
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,460
In the same way,humor is the same way.
幽默也是同样道理

731
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,120
Look at how much the context matters.
环境非常重要

732
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,660
If I said something this fact,
如果我说一个事实

733
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,510
this innocuous like,"I cut my toe nail."
一件毫无感情的事 如"我弄断趾甲了"

734
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,310
That's not really funny.
这一点都不好笑

735
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,410
But if I said "I cut my toe nail in the class".
但如果我说"我在上课时弄断了趾甲"

736
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,560
Suddenly it seems to be like a little bit more funny.
这样说就有点好笑了

737
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,580
Not Haha funny but a little bit funnier.
不是很好笑 但有点好笑了

738
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,600
Or "alcohol makes you drunk" is an innocuous fact.
"酒精能使人醉" 这是一个毫无感情的事实

739
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,880
"Alcohol makes you drunk"
"酒精能使人醉"

740
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,230
before giving a lecture on humor is a little bit funnier.
在上一节讲幽默的课前说这句话就有点好笑了

741
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,670
So part of what we are seeing here is that

742
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,100
the way that you view the environment,
你看待环境的视角

743
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,790
the way that you parse the world actually has a direct effect

好笑

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,680
This is something we call in my sections
在我的课堂上 我们有两样东西叫

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,020
in which our Beta press is actually malleable -

763
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,850
that we can change our Beta press,

in our adaptive behavior.

I think that humor is one of the most powerful ways

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,850
that we can actually change the Beta press by changing the way that

769
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,150
There are something that they found at Harvard medical school

and you try and make straight lines across.

779
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,090
the line disappears.

And you try to keep the shape going all the way up to the top.

781
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,170

At the medical school,they found that

after students played about 4,5 hours of Tetris straight

and went on with their lives for the most part.

788
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,510

"Oh,I'll shape car here to complete that line

looking at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Calendar Issue

797
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,470
and when they had all the,

798
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,050
like a lot of models all together at one.

who would fit and make that line all the way across."

801
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,470
Clearly what he was doing was parsing the entire world

even a swimsuit calendar into whether or not

he could change shapes in order to make straight lines.
他都看成能够改变形状 排出直直的一排

804
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,040
Every input has the brainwaves receiving.
每个输入的信息都有脑波接收

805
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,580
And our brains receive too much input all the time
我们的大脑接收了太多的信息

806
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,800
was being parsed through this one code.
大脑就形成了这个模式

807
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,010
Now what we find is that this is something
我们从中发现了一样东西

808
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,090
that I call a cognitive afterimage.
我称之为认知残象

809
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,020
A cognitive afterimage is just...
认知残象就是

810
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,440
If you stare the sun for a really long time,you are stupid.
如果你盯着太阳看一段时间 笨人做笨事

811
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,500
And what happens is you momentarily burn your retina.
结果就是你暂时性地烧伤了你的视网膜

812
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,290
And you can see this blue or green dot in your vision
你看东西时 就会看到一个蓝色或绿色的点

813
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,210
that goes around-
你看到哪里 它就跟到哪里

814
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,440
happens when a lot of flash photography goes off
我在Kirkland宿舍看到太多照相机闪光灯

815
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,810
when I'm at Kirkland House.
就会出现这种情况

816
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,290
There are a lot of times after when this can occur.
出现这种情况后 很多时候都会这样子

817
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,610
So what that is is the afterimage on your retina.
你的视网膜有一个残象

818
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,520
Well the same thing happens on the cognitive level as well.
在认知层面上也有同样的现象

819
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,340
Our brains can actually retain an afterimage and in Tetris effect
我们的大脑能保存一个残象 在俄罗斯方块效应里

820
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,020
what was happening is the cognitive afterimage,
学生会有一个认知残象

821
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,870
that people were getting stuck with,was viewing the world
这个残象会停留 他们看这个世界时

822
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,840
through the lens of parsing the world into ways
就会把世界上的事物看成

823
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,220
that can rotate shapes to make straight lines.
能够旋转变形 排进一条直线里

824
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,890
So too the individuals who are doing humor.
幽默的人也是这样

825
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,600
The people that can look at something like
当人们看到某件事…

826
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,450
writers for Jon Stewart,or the writers for Steven Colbert Report
例如Jon Stewart的编剧 或者"Steven Colbert报告"的编剧

827
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,740
When they look at the newspaper,
当他们看报纸时

828
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,870
when they see something that seems to be neutral
当他们看到一件不悲不喜的事

829
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,590
or even sad or tragic,they start to change the shape.
或者一件悲剧时 他们就开始让它变形

830
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,260
They rotate the shape in their mind.
他们在脑海里把这件事旋转变形

831
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,070
As a result,they are looking for patterns all the time.
结果他们就会不停地寻找模式

832
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,570
They are looking for multiple potentials within a status quo;
他们能从一件事上找到无限可能性

833
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,430
instead of just seeing a newspaper,
而不是只看到一张报纸

834
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,690
they see the possibility of humor that can come out of that.
他们能从报纸上看到幽默

835
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,720
And as you can find,
你们能发现

836
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,200
you can find that this can be a detriment sometimes as well.
认知残象有时也会带来坏处

837
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,100
You can get stuck in pattern
你会在一个思维模式中出不来

838
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,740
of looking for things that are humorous,
总是找幽默的东西

839
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,760
which can be adaptive or if you are in a fight,
这样有时会有利于适应 但如果你是和人吵架

840
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,920
and all you can do is making jokes - can be very mal-adaptive.
你唯一能做的就是开玩笑 这是非常不利于适应的

841
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,250
So one last thing about humor as a transformative lens
所以把幽默作为改变我们视角的东西还有一件事要注意的

842
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,560
before we talk about the benefits of humor is that
在我们讲幽默的益处前 我们先来讲一个这个

843
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,610
when we laugh at something,
当我们笑某件事时

844
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,980
Peter Berger argues that we get a momentary,
Peter Berger认为 我们会暂时性地

845
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,740
a momentary suspension of reality -
暂时地中止了现实

846
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,260
that when we can see something that is alternative to reality,
我们能看到一些有别于现实的东西

847
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,610
it teaches us that the status quo,
它让我们知道

848
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,920
the reality that we are seeing in front of us is both malleable
我们眼前的现实 是可塑的

849
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,790
and is not the only possible reality,
它不是唯一一种可能的现实

850
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,230
that the status quo absolutely can be changed.
现状是可以改变的

851
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,420
So humor provides a way of being actually more mindful.
所以幽默可以使我们变得更正念

852
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,230
Ellen Langer defines mindfulness
Ellen Langer把正念定义为

853
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,670
as "being present in the situation",
"留心眼前的情景"

854
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,910
so that you can be aware of the potentials in that environment.
这样你就能留意到环境中的可能性

855
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,320
The definition that I give for humor is almost word for word
我给幽默下的定义和正念的定义

856
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,650
of what you see with mindfulness.
几乎一模一样

857
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,920
The reason is that I think
原因是 我认为

858
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,990
when you are really present in the situation
当你真的留心眼前的情景

859
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,240
and when you view the world through a specific pattern,
当你以某种模式来看待世界时

860
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,570
what you are doing is you are actually parsing the world in a way
你实际上就是在用一种方式分析世界

861
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,980
that actually shows more potentials than that environment.

So Maslow argues that we have these peak experiences

I think we momentarily take on self-actualization,

869

because while we are provided with the reality,

don't have a negative effect upon us,

and the parasympathetic nervous system.
和副交感神经系统

P-A-R-A: the parasympathetic nervous system.

Now the problem with being super human all the time

and I should know is that it's catabolic,

is that when you dump these chemicals into your body

while your body becomes stronger momentarily,

Now that's not the end of the story fortunately,

because we don't just get more and more excited -

our heart rate keeps increasing until we just explode.
我们的心跳不会一直飙升 直到心脏爆炸

965
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,820
Because we have the other part of our central nervous system,

called the parasympathetic nervous system.

is responsible for calming the body down,

00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,320
for slowing our breath rate,for slowing our heart rate.

It's the part that actually causes rejuvenation.

And while we don't feel the spike in our energy levels,

we have a longer sustained period of energy,

because we are constantly revitalizing,

But we'll test on it anyway.
但我们还是会考

980
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,520
So the Soprano Effect
黑道家族效应

981
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:53,840
is the chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system.
是指长期地激活交感神经系统

982
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,950
And this is what a lot of Harvard students,including myself do,
很多哈佛学生 包括我自己都会这么做

983

is that when we are about go prepare for a test

I'm totally gonna fail this test."
我一定会不及格了"

00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,360
Or they say themselves,
或者他们心里想

990
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,540
"Oh,I'm so busy.I'm so busy.I'm so stressed."
"我太忙了 我压力太大了"

991
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,240
And when they do that,
当他们这么想时

992
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,860
what they are doing is we are leaving everything for last minute,
他们其实是把事情都留到最后一刻才做

996
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,830
because your sympathetic nervous system is activating.
因为你的交感神经系统被激活了

997
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,400
So we get used to that.

998
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,980

1009
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,760
that he was constantly activating his sympathetic nervous system,

And as a result of this,his body was just shutting down.

he was chronically activating his sympathetic nervous system.
他长期激活他的交感神经系统

00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,700
So the same thing that happens with Harvard students

1020
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,300
is that often times when we would decide to use that activation,

1021
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,310
that chronic activation of our sympathetic nervous system

The greatest buffer against the Soprano Effect is humor.

activate the parasympathetic nervous system.

And as a result of that,several extraordinary things happen.

1035
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,520
First of all,laughter itself is both medicine and exercise.
首先 笑本身既是一种药也是一种运动

1036
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:15,100
If you like Jack Candy and deep thoughts from Saturday Night Live
如果你喜欢Jack Candy和"周六夜现场"的"深层思考"小品

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,700

"as my father always said,the laughter is the best medicine.

其实不是很好笑 但我还是决定说这句

1041
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,440
And so it's also a form of exercise that every time you laugh,

if you've chosen to laugh at some point during this lecture,

what happens is your body is actually doing a lot of exercise.

is that researchers like Sultanoff found that

1088
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:39,620

00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:43,110
is they brought in people who had bronchial asthma.
他们找来一些患有支气管哮喘病的人

they exposed them to this dust mite which,umm,potentially fatal

everyone had an effect based upon this dust mite.

came back to the same experiment.

And that shouldn't have any effect

00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,330
I can't imagine -

1119
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,120
I was trying to think of funny jokes you could tell people.

I couldn't come up with anything.
但我想不出来

1121
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,860
You probably will think of something better than this,
你们想的笑话可能都比我想的这个要好笑

1122
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,100
but I think like.. No,actually I'm not gonna go for that.

Never mind.It wasn't funny.

but it isn't funny.
但我发现不好笑

1126
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,030
So we also find humor also increases pain tolerance.
我们还发现 幽默还能提高忍痛度

1127
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,100
So there's a group of German researchers C
有一群德国研究人员

1128
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,560
of course they would be German researchers -
除了德国研究人员还会有谁

1129
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,210
to find and put individuals,
他们找人来

1130
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,510
the participants to sign up for this study,

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,850
put their hands in ice cold ice water.
把他们的手放在冰冷的冰水里

1132
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,730
Now this is a standard way in psychology

and medical experience of testing somebody's pain tolerance.

1135
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,760
except for debilitating frost-bite.
只会加重他们的冻疮

1136
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,240
So what they find is that
他们发现

1137
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,170
they keep their hands in frozen bucket of ice water,
他们把手放进冰水桶里

1138
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,080
and during this period -
在这期间

1139
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,510
so the longer you keep it in,the better your pain tolerance is.
你的手放得越久 你的忍痛度就越高

1140
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,410
Try with your friends.This is a great party trick.

1142
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,200
is you can have one person watch a funny video,

00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,800
one person watch a neutral video,
一个人看不悲不喜的视频

1145
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,170
And what they found was that the group

00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,010
the reason why it's so awkward is the very first paper that

the students had to write was ten page paper

00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,140
And I had to make comments like

1222

that was most awkward about this is that they,
最尴尬的一次是

1227
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,940
for one of the sections
有一节课

1228
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,210
they wanted us to show condoms to the Harvard students,
他们想我给哈佛学生看看安全套是什么样的

1229

00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,530
they wanted us to give these condoms out in sections

so everyone could see one.

1234
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,370
And so I was teaching four sections for this class

她的桌子上 她脚下的地板上满是安全套

We'll come back.
我们等一下再讲

1256
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,710
Fraley found that if you bring people into a room,participants,
Fraley发现 如果你把实验参与者带到一个房间

and they are strangers,and you have them do cooperative task.

有个助教很喜欢我标题中的"吸引与感情"这两个词

我觉得很好笑 我想不起要讲什么了

1261
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,600
I'll talk about mirror neurons instead.
我讲另一个内容吧 镜像神经元

1262
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:28,440
Mirror neurons are awesome.Cause I skipped this a minute ago.
镜像神经元非常厉害 因为我刚才忘了讲这个

1263
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,280
Mirror neurons - we didn't even know we had it in brain,
镜像神经元 我们以前不知道大脑里有这个

1264
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,220
in the human brain until about ten years ago,
直到十年前才知道

1265
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,620
or actually about even less than that.
或能还不到十年

1266
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,690
Then we began to become aware of them .
我们那时才发现它们的存在

1267
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,300
But there's a part that if somebody smiles at you,
它们的作用就是 如果有人对你笑

1268
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,190
you almost have to smile back at them.
通常你一定也会对他们笑

1269
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,740
And the reason is because there's part of your brain
原因是 因为你大脑有个部位

1270
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,800
is lighting up as you are smiling as well,
在你笑时 亮起来了

1271
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:48,630
just as if I was standing on stage as somebody came over
就好像我站在讲台上 有个人走过来

1272
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,060
and tackled me really hard,and everyone goes,"Ooh."
狠狠地把我绊倒 大家都会惊呼

1273
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,600
You know like feeling mad C you are actually,
你们会觉得很愤怒

1274
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,070
your brain is lighting up those mirror neurons are lighting up,
你们有大脑会亮起来 那些镜像神经元会亮起来

1275
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,720
as if you just got tackled as well,
就好像你也被绊倒了一样

1276
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,410
which is reason why people groan at football games
这也是为什么人们看橄榄球比赛时会发生痛苦的叫声

1277
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,920
even if they are 2000 miles away from the actual stadium.
即使他们离体育场有2000英里远

1278
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,530
We are actually literally hardwired for empathy for other people.
我们天生会对别人有移情作用

1279
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,590
As a result of that,humor is extremely contagious,
因此 幽默非常具有传染性

1280
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,800
because these mirror neurons begin to activate
因为当我们看到别人笑时

1281
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,310
when we see other people laughing.
我们的镜像神经元就会激活

1282
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,650
Now the reason why this is helpful is because of the attraction
幽默之所以能帮助我们的社交 是因为

1283
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,120
that it causes in these first situations.
第一次相遇时 它能制造吸引力

1284
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,060
So what they found is they bring in strangers,
他们发现 他们找来互不认识的参与者

1285
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,040
have them play a competitive game.
让他们玩一个竞赛游戏

1286
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,230
Afterwards you have them rank the attractiveness and

you have somebody come in and you have them do a cooperative task

1291
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,500
This is similar to the Wall Street and community games studies
跟Tal这个学期讲过的

1292
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,840
that Tal was talking about earlier on this semester.

01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,940
you shouldn't attempt to do some sort of a competitive

people are attracted to in the physical domain,

six ways you can actually increase your humor levels as well.

First of all,we just talked about one of these.

So what you do is you go through your day,

when they are looking at the news.

you become better at the action at watching.

our mammalian brains are actually hardwired for variety,
