00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,650
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: Hi.Good afternoon.Good morning.
大家好 下午好 早上好

2
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,250
Today we are going to continue talking about love.
今天我们继续谈论爱情

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,300
But before,if there is a Nadia in this room,
讲之前先说一下 一位叫Nadia的同学

4
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,050
and you left a key chain in class.
你的钥匙链落在这教室了

5
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,700
We have it here.
就在我这里

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,150
So please come and see me afterwards.
课后请来我这里取

7
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,720
So let's talk about love.
那我们来讲讲爱情吧

8
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,210
Last time,we left off with more questions than answers.
上节课我们留下的问题多过答案

9
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,400
The question was- difficult question was
问题是…很难的问题

10
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,230
"how can we sustain love?
"我们怎样维持爱情

11
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,880
How can we sustain passion beyond the honeymoon phase?"
怎样在热恋期后维持激情"

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,940
Because even if we did have our Brad Pitt or Halle Berry,
因为即便我们觅得自己的布拉德皮特

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,030
that does not guarantee lasting passion.
或海利贝瑞 也不能确保激情长存

14
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,470
In fact,what we know that does guarantee over time
其实真正能确定的是

15
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,240
is a waning of the physiological excitement that
我们和那个人历经的生理上的兴奋

16
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,300
we experience when we are with that person.
会慢慢淡去

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,830
And that in part explains some of the statistics,
这在一定程度上解释了几个数据

18
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,870
such as 2/3 of marriages end up in divorce,
三分之二的婚姻以离婚告终

19
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,770
such as even those who do stay together
那些即便以后没有分开

20
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,250
after a while it's out of convenience,
也是出于省事

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,140
out of a sense of duty and not always,
出于责任

22
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,100
or more often than not
而不是因为

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,290
does not have the same sense of togetherness of passion
曾经在一起时的那种激情

24
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,670
that existed at the beginning of the relationship
那种在恋情一开始时存在的

25
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,480
with all the good intentions and the hope of the life-long
带着想要与之共度终生的

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,070
committed relationship- marriage or otherwise.
彼此承诺与对方长相厮守的美好夙愿

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,470
And then we asked "what positive psychology can do for us?"
若问"幸福心理学能为我们做什么?"

28
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,040
We asked the additional question to the normal question
这是对另一个问题的提问

29
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,470
that has been asked for many years,
另一个被问了很多年的问题

30
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,250
which is "why do so many relationships fail?"
"为什么这么多恋情失败的例子"?

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,250
It's an important question.It's necessary.
这问题很重要 很有必要问

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,380
It's very far from being sufficient.
这个问题涵盖面远远不够

33
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,260
And it leads to the same errors,
但这个问题犯了一个错误

34
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,710
to the same shortcomings that asking only the negative question
它有一个缺点 只问了消极的问题

35
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,190
leads to when we are studying at risk youth,
当我们研究问题少年

36
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,430
when we are studying time management and stress.
时间管理与压力时 也犯了这样的错误

37
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,640
Because when we only ask one of the questions,
因为当我们只问了消极的问题时

38
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,880
what we are missing are the children on the bus,
我们就会看不到巴士上的孩子

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,580
metaphorically speaking.
这是一个比喻

40
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,360
What we are missing are the colors in the reality in front us,
我们就会看不到眼前真实的颜色

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,960
if the only question we focus on is
如果我们仅关注一个问题

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,980
"how many geometric shapes are there?" Questions create reality.
"一共有多少几何形状?" 问题决定现实

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,700
And very often,if we don't certain question,
很多时候 如果我们不问某个问题

44
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,640
certain answers are obscure and disappear.
某些答案就不会出来

45
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,730
So we ask this question
所以我们来问这个问题

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,920
and we ask not just about "what makes relationships work",
不仅问"怎样让恋情维系下去"

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,600
but "what makes relationships thrive?"
还要问"怎样让恋情美好下去"

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,720
And psychologists such as David Schnarch and John Gottman
如David Schnarch和John Gottman两位心理学家

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,120
in their extraordinary books,
在他们写的大作中

50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,150
extraordinary research talk about some of these characteristics.
在他们的研究中 谈过这些方法特征

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,270
So let's get into them.
让我们来了解一下

52
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,000
The first one is about working hard.
第一个方法是努力

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,590
This is the world's best kept secret.It's the secret of success.
努力是世界上守得最好的秘诀 是成功的秘诀

54
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,900
It's the secret of personal success,of successful relationships.
是个人成功的秘诀 是感情成功的秘诀

55
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,310
There are no short cuts-
成功没有捷径

56
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,960
if we want a relationship to thrive,to succeed,
若想让一段恋情一直美好

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,720
we need to put a lot of work in it.
我们就得为之努力

58
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,110
Now that seems self-evident,obvious common sense.
这看起来似乎是不言而明的普遍常识

59
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,870
But so often in this class we have seen
但在这个班上 我们经常体会到

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,530
what Voltaire has remarked,"common sense is not that common."
正如伏尔泰所说"常识没那么寻常"

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,520
Now why is common sense not that common?
为什么要用常识来维持一段恋情时

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,750
When it applies to working hard in a relationship.
却发现这样的常识不是人人都有?

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,120
The reason is because
这是因为

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,680
many people have wrong expectations of the relationship
很多人对恋情有着错误的期望

65
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,970
or of what it means to have happy relationships specifically.
或者确切的说 对美好的恋情有着错误的期望

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,610
Most people believe that the most important part
大多数人认为拥有一段美好的

67
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,910
of enjoying a happy life-long committed relationship
至死不渝的恋情的关键在于

68
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,790
is finding the right partner.
寻找到真命天子

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,680
And that's certainly important,
这确实重要

70
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,600
but it is a mistake to focus on finding.
但是错在了将重点放在寻找上面

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,650
People have- if we draw an analogy to Carol Dweck's research
我们也套用一下Carol Dweck研究中的

72
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,080
on fixed versus malleable mindset-
固定心态和可塑心态的对比

73
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,880
people have a finding mindset that hurts the relationship.
人们有一种会破坏恋情的寻找心态

74
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,590
Let me explain.
我来为大家解释一下

75
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,780
So going back- we did this before spring break.
先回到春假前我们讲过的知识

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,040
What Carol Dweck showed was
Carol Dweck证明了

77
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,570
when we praise people for their intelligence-
当人们获得游戏测试成绩后

78
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,860
"oh you are so smart"-
我们赞赏他们"你真聪明"

79
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,180
after doing well on the test,they enter the fixed mindset.
这时他们就有了固定心态

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Versus if we praise them for "oh you've worked so hard".
相反 如果我们赞他们"你真努力"

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,130
They have a malleable mindset.And that has consequences.
他们就有了可塑心态 这两种心态都会产生影响

82
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,800
Because the fixed mindset-
因为固定心态

83
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,360
the intelligence- "you are so smart" doesn't help them much.
即赞赏"你真聪明"帮不上什么

84
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,450
And then when they go to the next puzzle,
却在他们进入下一轮测试时

85
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,780
next task which is difficult,that threatens their schema-
当测试变难 威胁到对自己的自我定位

86
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,540
"oh if I don't get it,if I don't succeed,
"若做不出来

87
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,430
it means I'm no longer smart." And they give up more easily.
便说明我不聪明了" 这时他们便更容易放弃

88
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,840
They are more threatened by failure.
他们更易被失败威胁到

89
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,380
And they don't enjoy the process.
他们也无法享受过程

90
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,510
They become perfectionists,
他们变成了完美主义者

91
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,200
or more likely to become perfectionists.
或者说更倾向于变成完美主义者

92
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,290
OK,so this is the fixed mindset.
这就是固定心态

93
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,950
You are so smart.You are so intelligent.
你真聪明 你的智商真高

94
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,290
The malleable mindset- "oh you work so hard".
而可塑心态 "你真努力"

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,950
Oh I can work with that.
我会努力做的

96
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,870
So even if I don't succeed,don't do well,
即便我没成功 没做好

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,530
I can still learn and I do learn to enjoy the process more.
我也照样能学习 能够更享受过程

98
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,470
So that's the malleable mindset.
这就是可塑心态

99
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,980
Now let's draw an analogy to what we've just discussed here.
现在将这个理论运用到恋情上来

100
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,620
If I believe that the most important thing
如果我认为拥有一段至死不渝的

101
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,370
about enjoying life-long,committed,
幸福的恋情的最关键所在

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,540
happy relationship is finding the right partner,
寻找到真命天子

103
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:58,950
I enter what I call- again by analogy,the finding mindset,
这里的寻找心态就相当于

104
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:08,580
which will be an equivalent to Dweck's fixed mindset.
Dweck提出的固定心态

105
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,400
And then let's say I have this mindset.
假设我现在就有这种寻找心态

106
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,580
This is the most important thing.
认为这是最重要的事

107
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,730
And then we go through a rough patch in our relationship.
此时若我们的恋情经历一段艰难岁月

108
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,120
Then what happens? Then I begin to think "wait a minute.
接下来会怎样呢?我会开始思索

109
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,770
Something's wrong here.I must have not found the right partner.
"不对 我肯定是还未找到真命天子

110
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,490
I must have made a mistake- an error of judgment."
我肯定弄错了 找错了对象"

111
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,580
And that very often leads to a worsening of the situation.
这种心态常会让情况恶化

112
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,590
And it can,doesn't always,but can lead to a downward spiral.
可能会导致恶性循环

113
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,330
This is the finding mindset.
这就是寻找心态

114
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,860
Because it's fixed I found my knight in shining armor.
因为这种心态是固定的 我找到了白马王子

115
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,540
I found my dream woman.I found my Brad Pitt,my Halle Berry.
我找到了自己的女神 我的皮特我的贝瑞

116
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,790
And you know that problem is that reality inevitably hits.
问题是现实总是残酷的

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,980
We can't run away from it.
我们无法脱离现实

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,720
And reality dictates that there are no perfect relationships.
现实证明完美的恋情根本不存在

119
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,360
Remember that Leo Buscaglia's quote about,
记住Leo Buscaglia曾说过

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,620
"perfect love is rare indeed."
"完美的爱情少之又少"

121
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,420
No it's not rare.It doesn't exist.
不 不是少 而是没有

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,230
And when we realize that-
当我们意识到

123
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,870
if we have the finding mindset,the fixed mindset,
若我们有了寻找心态 这种固定心态

124
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,320
it threatens our schema.
它会威胁到我们的自我认定

125
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,940
There is inconsistency and then we begin to think
一有矛盾发生我们就开始琢磨

126
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,490
"well I probably did not find the right person."
"估计我还没找到真命天子"

127
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:43,890
In contrast,if we have the cultivating mindset,that's malleable
若我们反过来抱着培养心态 这种心态是可塑的

128
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,880
That's related to the effort part- "OK.
它与我们的努力相关 "好的

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,620
So we are going through a hardship.
我们的感情碰到了困难

130
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,450
We are going through difficulty.
我们在经历困境

131
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,610
But it's OK.Because we are working on it.
但不怕 因为我们在努力改善

132
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,590
We are working to resolve it."
我们在努力解决问题"

133
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,940
It's like the students who were praised for their effort- "OK.
这就像那些被赞扬努力的学生 "好的

134
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,460
So I'm not solving this puzzle now.
虽然我现在解决不了问题

135
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,220
But so what? I'm putting in a lot of effort.
但又怎样呢?我在努力

136
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,570
I'm trying; I'm even enjoying the process."
我在尝试 我甚至在享受这过程"

137
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,810
Look at the direct parallel here between Dweck's work
看这类比多么相似 Dweck研究的心态

138
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,560
on mindset and our mindset when it comes to relationships.
和我们用在恋情上的心态

139
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,280
So important- it makes such big difference.
如此之重要 两种心态 结果相差甚远

140
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,800
And very often we can switch it-
很多时候我们是可以转变这心态的

141
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,010
not immediately,relatively promptly.
不是马上可以变 但也不用太多时间

142
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,630
Remember Carol Dweck was able to change mindset of people
要知道Carol Dweck能靠一个

143
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,550
in a single experiment,in a few hours.
几小时的实验就将人们的心态转变

144
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,770
And we can do the same in our relationship
我们也能在对待恋情上转变心态

145
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,630
if we truly accept and internalize the fact
只要我们真正接受并内化一个事实

146
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,550
that relationships or finding the right partner,
那就是在一段恋情中 找到真命天子

147
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,510
a good partner is of course important.
找到合适的人 当然重要

148
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,090
It is much more important to then cultivate that relationship.
但培养一段感情更重要

149
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,960
We'll get to that in a minute.
这个一会再讲

150
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,510
But the question then arises:
但是问题接踵而来

151
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,190
so why do people have the finding mindset?
为什么人们会有寻找心态呢?

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,360
Why do people have or not have the cultivating mindset?
如果培养心态更健康

153
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,040
If it is healthier.
为什么人们没有培养心态呢?

154
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,350
One of the main reasons are the movies.Now movies are wonderful.
主要原因之一在于电影 现在的电影很精彩

155
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,930
They are terrific.They show us what is possible.
电影很棒 向我们展现一切皆有可能

156
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,090
Aristotle once said about art that it's -or about fiction-
亚里士多德曾对小说发表如下看法

157
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,260
that it's more important than history,
小说远重于历史

158
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,450
because history depicts things as they are,
因为历史只是白描

159
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,250
whereas fiction depicts things as they can and ought to be.
而小说却将一切描述到了极致

160
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,090
So it's a wonderful thing;
所以说电影是很美好的

161
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,500
it shows us some model of what's possible,
它让我们看到了可能性

162
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,490
especially the romantic movies.
尤其是浪漫的电影

163
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,860
I don't mean romantic in terms of love,
这里的浪漫不是指爱情上的浪漫

164
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,850
romantic in the 18th,19th centuries sense of romantic,
是指18 19世纪的浪漫主义

165
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,380
showing us how things can work,how things can become,
向我们展示事物可以有多美好

166
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,210
the potential,human nature relationships of our world.
潜在的人性 我们与世界的关系

167
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,420
So it's a wonderful thing.
这是件很美妙的事

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,410
But one thing that movies don't do well is that
但是电影有一点没做好

169
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,010
they focus on the finding of the right partner,
电影聚焦于找到真命天子

170
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,360
and hence very often entrench,reinforce the finding mindset.
于是这就巩固加强了寻找心态

171
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,600
Because most of the movies,
因为大多数电影

172
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,070
love stories look like this: there are struggles;
爱情故事总是这样的 有挣扎

173
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,940
there are fights; there are disagreements;
有争吵 有意见相左

174
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,300
there are challenges on the way.
途中挑战不断

175
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,150
And then at the end,
到最后

176
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,910
Mr and Mrs Smith get together and they live happily ever after.
Smith夫妇走到了一起 从此幸福生活

177
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,540
The screen drops and they walk into the sunset.
荧幕落下 他们走向夕阳

178
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,510
You know what problem is with that picture?
你们知道这画面有什么问题吗?

179
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,960
The problem is that movies end where love begins.
问题就在于 爱情才刚开始 电影就结束了

180
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,770
It is after the screen drops that the actual work starts.
荧幕落下后才要开始真正的努力

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,840
It is easy to have a good relationship at the beginning,
在刚开始时 要恋情顺利是很容易的

182
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,730
the honey moon phase
蜜月期

183
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,030
or you know through the first year or two usually.
或者说一开始的一两年

184
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,700
But then what happens after a while
但是这之后

185
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:18,040
when the initial physical,physiological instinct wanes?
当最初的肉体上 生理本能淡去

186
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,860
What happens when we start to recognize and understand
当我们开始意识到

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,570
and realize and see that- well this partner is not perfect.
我们的伴侣并不完美时会怎样?

188
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,710
What happens then? Well,that's when true love begins.
会怎样?这就是爱情开始的时候了

189
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,460
And that's where true love is cultivated and formed.
这也是真爱得以培养并形成之际

190
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:41,110
Now I'm not belittling the importance of finding a partner,
我并不是贬损寻找

191
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,820
the right partner,the right person for us.
真命天子的重要性

192
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,480
It is of course important.
这当然重要

193
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,940
And often it takes kissing many frogs before we find our prince.
通常找到王子前要亲无数只青蛙

194
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,880
But the more important part of a thriving long term relationship
但是对于一份美好而持久的恋情

195
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,200
is the cultivation.
培养更重要

196
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,870
This is where the effort starts.
这才是努力开始的地方

197
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,680
It's after the sunset; the difficulties and hardships rise.
在日落之后 困难与险阻浮现

198
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,510
Now connect it to this,to the mindset is the notion
与寻找心态紧紧相连的

199
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,010
that there is only one right person for us.
是真命天子只有一个这样的观念

200
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,830
And all I need to do,all I need to dedicate all my effort
我所需要做的就是

201
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,620
and time to is find that right person.
穷尽一生找到那个真命天子

202
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,440
And if I have to go all the way to Yale
如果得去耶鲁大学找

203
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,120
I'll go there to find that person.
我也会愿意去

204
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,060
A modern version of a Shakespeare in tragedy perhaps.
就像是莎翁悲剧的现代版

205
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,810
Whatever I need to do I will do it-
不论需要做什么 我都愿意做

206
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,700
just to find that one right person-
只要能找到真命天子

207
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,160
even if I'm in Boston,they are in Seattle.
即便我在波士顿 他们在西雅图

208
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,730
I will find that right person.
我总会找到真命天子

209
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,350
I don't believe that.It's simply not true.
我不信这套 不现实

210
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,410
It's not the matter of faith.
这不是信念的问题

211
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,710
I mean we know many people
我的意思是 很多人

212
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,310
who thought they found the right person,
觉得找到了真命天子

213
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,490
maybe did find the right person,
也许确实是找到了

214
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,250
and then either for tragic reasons
却因为不幸的原因

215
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,270
or for good reasons they were no longer together.
或是为了正确的原因 没能继续下去

216
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,550
And they found more love.
他们之后反而找到更多爱情

217
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,830
There are 6 billion people in the world.
这世界上有60亿人口

218
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,720
There's more than one right person.
真命天子绝非仅一个

219
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,390
So what makes relationship unique?
那么是什么让恋情独特的呢?

220
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,160
It's not finding that one right person.
不是找到真命天子

221
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,010
Once again it's cultivating that one chosen relationship.
而是与你选择的恋人培养恋情

222
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,260
It's by virtue of working together,of being together,
通过共同的努力 共同在一起

223
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,160
of spending time together,of dedicating one another.
共同度过 彼此奉献

224
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,850
That's how we create the one chosen relationship,
这是创造一段恋情的方式

225
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,070
one special relationship.
一段独特的恋情

226
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,040
That's how two separate "I"s become a "we".
让两个"我"变成一个"我们"

227
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,750
And again to do that,it doesn't happen over night.
再次重申 这不能在一夜间完成

228
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,100
It doesn't even happen in a year or two.It takes time.
甚至不能在一两年里完成 需要时间

229
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,970
In fact,it doesn't happen; it is happening.It's a process.
事实上感情没有完成一说 这是一个过程

230
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,040
It's not about success in a relationship;
它无关恋情的成功

231
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,320
it's about succeeding in a relationship.
而是恋情的延续

232
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,580
We cultivated relationship not just simply by putting on the ring
恋情的培养不仅靠交换戒指

233
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,250
or by giving the vows.
或是结婚誓言

234
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,940
It's by doing things together.
而更要靠共同参与

235
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,550
Why is that so important?
这为什么很重要呢?

236
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,440
Let me draw on some research from other areas of psychology.
我们讲一下心理学其他领域的研究

237
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,520
And this is something that I mentioned on a couple of occasions.
我在其他场合曾提过几次

238
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,520
Some of the most important work done by Muzafer Sherif
Muzafer Sherif在20世纪50年代

239
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,870
back in the 1950s,and until Muzafer Sherif came along.
完成的伟大研究之一 在Muzafer Sherif之前

240
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,340
As I mentioned before,the hypothesis that people had
我之前说过了 人们有这样一个假说

241
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,130
when it comes to resolving interpersonal conflicts
当要解决人际冲突

242
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,550
or inter-group conflicts,
或者群体间冲突时

243
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,160
the belief that people had was that
人们认为此时的解决方法就是

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,680
all you need to do is get the conflicting sides together.
让冲突双方聚在一起就行了

245
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,640
The dominant hypothesis was what's called "contact hypothesis".
这个主流假说被称为"接触假说"

246
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,970
Get the two conflicting sides in touch with one another
让冲突双方相接触

247
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,130
whether it's conflicting ethnic groups,
无论是族群冲突

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,320
whether it's conflicting individuals.
还是个人间冲突

249
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,910
Get them together and you will resolve the conflict.
让他们聚在一起 冲突就能解决

250
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,090
This was much of the work done by Gordon Allport
这一理论主要由Gordon Allport提出

251
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,240
in our department here back in the 1930s.
在20世纪30年代我们的心理学系

252
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,130
Muzafer Sherif comes along and shows that that's not the case.
Muzafer Sherif出现后 指出这不行

253
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,140
In fact,just bringing them together,
事实上 仅让冲突双方聚首

254
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,720
just the contact of the conflicting sides very often,more often
让冲突双方接触

255
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,540
than not intensifies the conflict rather than resolve it.
通常反而会激化矛盾 而非解决矛盾

256
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,130
And I gave this in a context of Arabic-Israelis conflict,
我讲这个时 用阿以冲突作为例子

257
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,880
where people just got together
那里的人们聚在一起

258
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,930
and hope that there will be peace in our time.
希望能实现两国间的和平交往

259
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,480
And instead we got more war in our time.Contact is not enough.
但反而挑起了更多的战争 仅接触是不够的

260
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,880
Not when it comes to bringing nations together;
不仅不适用于国家间冲突

261
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,930
not when it comes to bringing ethnic groups together;
不适用于族群间冲突

262
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,540
and not when it comes to bringing a couple together.
也不适用于夫妻间冲突

263
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,740
You see in a relationship,inevitably there are conflicts.
一段恋情中 发生冲突不可避免

264
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,230
Inevitably.There is no perfect relationship.
这世上没有完美的恋情

265
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,070
And if there were perfect relationship,
即便有了完美恋情

266
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,170
it would not be a conflict-free relationship,
也会有冲突的完美恋情

267
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,120
as we'll see shortly.
对此马上会为大家讲解到

268
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,080
So there are conflicts in our relationship-
我们的恋情会有冲突

269
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,580
whether it's during the first year
不是在第一年里出现

270
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,620
or whether it's after two or three years.
就是在两三年后出现

271
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,020
And serious conflicts- I'm not just saying about you know,
而至于重大冲突 这里不是指

272
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,310
conflict about "well you should put down the toilet seat"
类似于"你怎么不放下马桶盖"

273
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
or "keep it up".
"把马桶盖掀起来"的冲突

274
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,940
I mean serious conflicts.Well that could be serious I guess.
当然马桶盖冲突也会变得很严重

275
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,580
But other serious conflicts.
但我指的是其他重大冲突

276
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,720
And when there is a conflict,
当这样的重大冲突出现时

277
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,580
and all the couples are doing together,simply being together,
一段关系中的双方只是聚在一起

278
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,900
in touch with one another-
相互接触

279
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,150
that's not enough to resolve that conflict.
这不足以解决冲突

280
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,810
And very often it will start as a minor conflict
很多情况下 反而会由小冲突

281
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,840
and then get worse- spiral up,or rather spiral down over time.
转化为大冲突 冲突逐渐升级

282
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,320
So what does Sherif say and what do we know today?
Sherif对此有什么建议?我们研究出什么方法了?

283
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,140
That the important thing in resolving conflicts
解决冲突的要点之一

284
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,890
is having a super ordinate goal.
在于确立一个超然目标

285
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,140
When the two ethnic groups,when the two nations work together,
当两个民族或国家共同努力

286
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,450
and are inter-dependent-
彼此互助

287
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,410
whether it's in business,or in a relationship,
无论在公事上还是恋情上

288
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,000
it could be raising children- but doing the things together,
例如共同抚养孩子 只要共同努力

289
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,620
or belonging to the same political campaign,
不管属于同一个政治阵营

290
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,740
or opposite political campaigns- that's fine.
还是相对立的两个政治阵营 都可以

291
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,650
But working together,
只要共同努力

292
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,620
supporting one another and when you have the working together,
彼此支持对方 当你们共同努力

293
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,770
the doing together,
共同参与时

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,270
that's when you are most likely to resolve the conflicts.
才是你们可能解决冲突之时

295
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,110
And in fact these conflicts as we'll see shortly
我们很快就会看到这样的冲突

296
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,940
can make the relationship even stronger.
反而还能让恋情变得更加巩固

297
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,030
But the couple need mutually meaningful goals.
但情侣间需要共同的有意义的目标

298
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,560
And again,it could be having children together
再说一遍 可以是一起要个孩子

299
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,950
and raising the children together.
共同抚养

300
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,920
You know not just the "OK.We had the child.
不是"我们有个孩子

301
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,120
And then the mother or the father raise the kid-
由父亲或母亲抚养

302
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,020
more often the mother."
通常会是母亲"这样

303
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,290
And OK.So we did something together.No.
这样不算是共同努力了

304
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,450
The kid has to be to put in a very delicate and-
孩子必须处于一种微妙的位置

305
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,660
I'm sure appropriate terms- the kid has to be a joint venture.
用专业术语来说 孩子应是合资企业

306
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,220
Isn't it a lovely term to describe having kids?
用这个术语来比喻生孩子是不是很有爱?

307
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,310
As long as they don't bring any bad debt

308
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,540
or you know there is a good return on investment.

309
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,080
Yeah,just the right language there.
非常适合的经济学术语

310
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,470
Took me a while to think about it.
琢磨琢磨一下就往上套

311
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,260
So working together,bringing up the kids together,
共同做事 共同抚育孩子

312
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,620
or being on campaigns together,
或是共同参与竞选

313
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,250
or helping one another at work but doing things together.
或在工作上给对方帮助 但要共同为之

314
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,580
John Gottman: "In the strongest marriages,

315
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,300
husband and wife share a deep sense of meaning.
丈夫与妻子彼此间深度融合

316
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,130
They don't just "get along"-

317
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,950
they also support each other's hopes and aspirations

and build a sense of purpose into their lives together."

319
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,050
That doesn't mean that they have to do everything together.
这不是说他们要什么都一起做

320
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,500
I mean it's OK
我的意思是

321
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,620
for one to have his or her own meaningful goals at work,
他或她可以在工作上有自己的目标

322
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,210
where they don't work together- that's perfectly fine.
而他们并不一起工作 这完全没问题

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,330
But in addition there have to be things that are done together.
但是必须要有他们共同做的事

324
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,060
In other words,what we need is an active kind of love.

You know the first time I really understood

who's one of my best friends in Israel told me.

when Noam came home from hospital with his wife,his mom,

Shahar didn't really feel love toward Noam.

He was very cute and adorable.

he thought he should have felt.

339
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,200
Needless to say he felt enormously guilty about it.
更别提他对此有多愧疚了

340
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,390
That didn't last for long fortunately.
幸运的是这没有持续很久

341
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,800
Because as soon as Shahar started to taking care,

started taking care of Noam which meant changing his diapers,

that's when the love was cultivated.

So it wasn't natural.

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,360
For some people it is natural- for women more often,

350
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,250
but not always,more often than men.
但不是女生都是这样 总体来说高于男人

351
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,550
So we can rely on and wait for this natural thing to happen
我们可以等着这感觉自然发生

352
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,430
or we can actively engage in activities

based on how we behave.

So examples we used in the past:

358
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,170
if I see myself going up to someone and ask them out,
如果我想象自己会去约会某人

359
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,010
even if they say no,I perceive myself as someone with confidence

If I see myself trying out for plays,

I will perceive myself as someone courageous.

363
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,640
If I perceive myself as...
如果我感到自己

364
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,010
If if I take care of myself,I'll see myself
如果我照顾自己 我会感到自己

365
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,550
as someone with self-esteem who cares about him or herself.
是自尊自爱 关心自己或关心她的人

366
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,230
So the same with children.
这对孩子也是一样的

367
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,980
If I see myself taking care of my child,
若我想象自己能照顾孩子

368
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,750
my conclusion in self-perception theory
根据自我知觉理论 我会得出

369
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,620
is "oh I must love that child".
"我一定很爱那孩子"的结论

370
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,850
And that love actually intensifies over time,
这爱会随着时间而加深

371
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,720
whether it's with children,whether it's with partners.
无论是对孩子还是对伴侣

372
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,430
We may experience the love automatically at the beginning;
爱情开始时也许是自发感受到的

373
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,370
it could be the love at the first sight.
也许是一见钟情

374
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,490
However,if we don't sustain the active love,
尽管如此 若我们不主动维持爱情

375
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,590
over time because of self-perception theory,
长此以往 由于自我知觉理论

376
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,910
over time that will go away.
那份最初的激情会淡去

377
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,200
Because I don't invest anything in a relationship,
因为我们没在恋情中有所投入

378
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,710
self-perception theory-
自我知觉理论会告诉我们

379
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,330
"oh it must not be that important for you."
"这恋情对我一定不怎么重要"

380
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,470
And then the love wanes- not to mention
爱情慢慢淡去 更不必提

381
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,410
all the physiological reasons why it wanes over time.
激情被时间冲刷掉的生理原因了

382
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,420
So if there isn't the active love,it cannot be sustained.
如果没有主动爱情 则恋情无以为继

383
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,240
How do we sustain love? How do we remain active?

meals with the whole family additional at least.

389
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,290
But we have these rituals.
但我们确有这些老规矩

390
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,350
Because without rituals,in our modern world,
因为在现代社会 若没有这些老规矩

391
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,310
the important yet not urgent in the words of Steven Covey,
用Steven Covey的话说是 重要却非紧急

392
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,070
the important and yet not urgent activities will take a backseat.
重要却非紧急的活动就会被冷落

393
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,850
So yeah we know it's important to go on dates.
即便我们知道出去约会很重要

394
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,030
But it's not as urgent as phone call I just receive from work
但不如刚接到的工作来电紧急

395
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,950
and I have to wait or stay at work,whereas if there is a ritual,
所以我不得不放弃约会 留下来加班 然而若有老规矩

396
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,200
if we do it no matter what then it will sustain itself.

398
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,900

What is being known rather than being validated mean?

First of all one thing that David Schnarch and others have shown

414
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,930
is that if we want to sustain passion beyond the honeymoon phase,

what we need to do is form deeper levels of intimacy.

430
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,190
that means we must open up.

精彩美妙的事 当然也包括这些

435
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,680
But in addition,
但是除此以外

436
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,490
also the things that sometimes we are not that proud of.
还包括一些让我们不怎么自豪的事

437
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,150
Our weaknesses perhaps.
也许是我们的缺点

438
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,610
Some of the things that maybe we are ashamed of,
也许是我们耻于提及的

439
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,700
that we don't feel very comfortable...
让我们觉得不舒服

440
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,990
That no one knows about us.
不为人知的事情

441
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,390
Now that does not happen on the first date-
这些事不会在首次约会上讲出来

442
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,070
it shouldn't happened on the first date.
这也不该在首次约会讲

443
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,810
Very often it doesn't happen after 5 or 10  years.
很多情况下 甚至不会在五年十年内讲

444
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,950
It happens gradually over time as trust increases,
只有经过长年累月的信任加增

445
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,140
and reveal more and more...
逐渐坦露出来

446
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,700
Sometimes we reveal things about ourselves
有时我们坦露的是

447
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,470
that we didn't even know that existed;
自己都不知道的

448
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,360
that we repressed or suppressed over time.
被我们压抑了很久的事

449
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,700
But it takes time,
但这需要时间

450
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,090
which is why going back to David Schnarch's quote
这也是要回到David Schnarch关于

451
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,440
about cellulite and sexual potential,
脂肪团和性能力的言论上

452
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,950
that usually happens after age 10,20,30 years,
这通常发生在10年20年30年后

453
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,270
which is why at the age of 50 and 60,
这也是为什么到了五六十岁时

454
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,670
there is even better sexual potential
甚至会有比18 20 30岁时

455
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,730
than at the age of 18 or 20 or 30.
更强的性能力

456
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,730
Doesn't mean it can't be great at 18,20 and 30,
倒不是说18 20 30岁时不好

457
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,180
but it can be even greater.Why?
而是会比年轻时更好 为什么?

458
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,810
Because deeper levels of intimacy,deeper level of connectedness.
因为有了更深层的亲密联系

459
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,690
A lot of look forward to,
若我们理解了充满激情的关系的本质

460
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:56,180
if we understand what is the nature of passionate relationship.
这段关系就有很多东西值得我们期待

461
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,560
It cannot just rely on "well we came together;
这不能仅靠"我们在一起

462
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,790
I found my princess/prince charming and we'll live happily after"
我找到了梦中情人 我们会幸福一生"

463
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,880
No,it means also taking risks at times.
不是这样的 这有时是有风险的

464
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,470
It means revealing over time our deepest desires,
意味着除了坦露我们内心深处的需求

465
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,260
our deepest fantasies,
我们最深的幻想

466
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,900

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,240
our insecurities and our passions.

468
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,690

要坦露 要敞开心扉 就要做到这些

469
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,030
What it means is that
这意味着

470
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,570
a healthy relationship is about expressing ourselves
一段健康的恋情 需要我们表达自己

471
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,350
rather than trying to constantly impress.
而非长期抑制自己

472
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,890
This is the difference between being known-
这就是被了解与被认可的区别

473
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,460
express versus being validated- let me impress her;
被了解是要表达自己

474
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,880
let me impress him; let me impress them.
被认可则是要取悦别人

475
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,570
The thing about this is that- yes,
这样做是有缺点

476
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:56,060
it is more risky to open up,to express ourselves.
敞开心扉表达自己风险更高

477
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,350
Because what if she doesn't like me?
因为若她不喜欢这样的我 怎么办?

478
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,350
What if he doesn't like what he finds out about me?
如果他深入了解我后 不喜欢我怎么办?

479
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,640
But you see when we express,
但是要知道当我们表达自己时

480
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,170
we are more likely to have a thriving relationship-
我们更可能收获一段美好的恋情

481
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,160
it's not guaranteed by any stretch of imagination.
但是没什么可以保证一定就有好恋情

482
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,850
It's not guaranteed.
这无法保证的

483
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,030
However if we just impress,we are guaranteed failure.
然而若我们一味抑制自己 失败是肯定的

484
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,130
Here is why.
原因如下

485
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,220
First of all,when we express,generally,over time,
首先 当我们逐渐敞开心扉

486
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,450
maybe not in the short term,but over time,
也许短时间内没有效果 但是

487
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,850
people will be more attracted to us,-
随着时间的流逝 人们会被我们吸引

488
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,650
specifically my partner will like me even more over time
特别是我的伴侣会逐渐更喜欢我

489
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,350
because of our deeper levels of intimacy,
因为我们有了深层次的亲密关系

490
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,190
even they sometimes find out things that
即便有时他们对于刚了解的

491
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,940
they don't necessarily like or adore or appreciate.
关于我们的事不是很喜欢或赞赏

492
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,830
Over time it's people who are genuine,
但久而久之 真诚的人

493
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,620
who will attract other people and-
会吸引到其他人

494
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,880
by the way this applies in the realm of C
而且 这种方法也适用于

495
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,110
of course- interpersonal relationships.
人际关系领域

496
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,310
It applies in the realm of friendships.
它适用于友情

497
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,810
And it applies in the realm of leadership- the greatest leaders,
适用于提高领导能力

498
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,360
as Peter Drucker has illustrated,
像Peter Drucker阐述的那样

499
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,690
are not the people who are the most charismatic.
最伟大的领导不是最有魅力的

500
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,010
They are not the people who are the most engaging.
也不是最迷人的那些人

501
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,610
They are the people who have the highest levels of integrity.
而是极其诚实正直的人

502
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,830
These are the leaders
这样的领导

503
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,530
whom followers follow over time in a long term.
他的属下会长久追随他

504
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,850
So whether it's interpersonal group relationships
无论是团体间的人际关系

505
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,540
or individual relationships,
还是个人之间的私交关系

506
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,630
when we express ourselves,we are much more likely to thrive.
只要我们坦诚 就更可能被容纳接受

507
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,320
The second thing though is,that's important to keep in mind,
第二件应该时刻谨记的是

508
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,760
is that let's say I impress and I do such a good job of it
如果我给人留下了一个很好的印象

509
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,120
that the other person or the other group actually likes me.
使得这个人 或者这群人 都很喜欢我

510
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,620
It worked.I won.
这奏效了 我成功了

511
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,040
Well,have I? Who do they really like?
可这是真的吗?他们喜欢的是谁呢?

512
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,840
Do they like me or do they like that image,
他们喜欢的是我还是那个形象

513
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,800
that facade that I put on.
是我塑造的那个戴着面具的人吗?

514
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,070
In other words,it's not me that they really like.
换言之 他们喜欢的不是真正的我

515
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,950
And it may look like it.But it's pretense.
也许看起来是 但那不是真的

516
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,230
It's make-believe.It's not the real thing.In other words,I lose.
这喜欢是假象 换言之 我失败了

517
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,400
And it certainly cannot sustain itself over time.
而且这种假象也维持不了太久

518
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,530
So we have more likelihood of succeeding when we express;
所以说坦诚相待更可能持久

519
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,150
and zero likelihood of succeeding in the long term
而当我们的目标是给人留下一个好印象时

520
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
when our primary objective is impress.
这种情形持久的可能性为零

521
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,920
Now this does not mean going on first date
这并不是要你在第一次约会

522
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,880
and not trying to impress.
就放弃尝试给对方留下深刻印象

523
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,360
I mean I've not met anyone
我是说我还没见过谁没尝试过

524
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,280
who has not tried to impress on the first date or the 10th,
在首次甚至第十次约会 乃至第十次约会

525
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,350
or after 10 years- that's OK.However,
给对方留下深刻印象 这是可以的

526
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,370
what is the primary motivator in our time being together?
然而 共同生活最重要的动因是什么?

527
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,050
Just like we reveal,we open up,we share,
就像我们前面说的那样 敞开心扉

528
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,770
we also need to get and make active effort

529
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,800
to get to know our partner,to know what their favorite wine is,

532
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,650
what are their fears,what are their desires;
他们怕什么 渴望什么

533
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,470
when is it a good time to maybe give their own space,
什么时候该给他们一些独处的空间

534
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,410
when is it a good time to talk to them,
什么时候该和他们沟通

535
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,420
when is it a good time to touch them.
什么时候该触碰他们

536
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,640
And all these things take time.
所有这些都需要时间

537
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,660
It doesn't happen on the first date.
这不可能在首次约会时实现

538
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,030
It doesn't happen in the first year.
也不会在第一年里实现

539
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,520
And it doesn't all happen in the first ten years,or thirty years
不会在头10年或30年全部实现

540
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,580
That's what it means to create a lifelong thriving relationship
这意味着我们要用一生的时间

541
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,950
that we get to know the other person throughout our lives.
去了解对方 营造一生的美好恋情

542
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,150
My grandfather and grandmother,my role models,
我的祖父祖母

543
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,170
when it comes to relationships,
是我在感情方面的榜样

544
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,690
got to know each other deeper and better after 50 years as well.

547
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,340
David Schnarch:
David Schnarch说过

548
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,840
"Intimacy is about letting yourself really be known,
"亲密就是让你自己被真正的了解

549
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,950
including parts that you or your partner don't like.
即使是你或你伴侣不喜欢的 也要被了解

550
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,370
But it's not just about letting 'warts' be known.
但这并不代表坦露的都是缺点

551
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,070
It often involves showing strengths you've been hiding,too.
有时也会是一直没发现的优点

552
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,460
Most approaches
大部分方法

553
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,040
focus on getting your partner's validation and acceptance
都专注于让你的伴侣 在你坦露时

554
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,810
when you disclose.
认同和接受你

555
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,040
But you can't count on this,and if you try,
但你不能寄希望于此 如果你心存这样的意图

556
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,560
it inherently limits self-disclosure
那么你坦露心声时必然有所掣肘

557
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,420
because you won't say things your partner won't validate.
因你只会说那些让你的伴侣认可的话

558
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,620
Resolving gridlock requires intimacy

559
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,930
based on validating yourself."
这基于认可你自己"

Many,if not most,couples counselors,sex therapists believe

562
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,450

564
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,320

Of course I validate my partner.

00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,810
However,that's not the foundation of a healthy relationship.
然而这不是健康恋情的基础

568
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,320
And this is where most therapists,
而这是很多治疗师

569
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,830
most couples are and this is where I was wrong-
很多夫妻以及我曾犯过的错误

570
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,220
not understanding the foundation is to be known,

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,010
or a relationship with friends.
还是与朋友的友情中

573
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,910
You see when you disclose,when you disclose,
当你坦露心声时

574
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,990
you are taking a risk.
你是冒着风险的

575
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,050
And very often,
而且很多时候

576
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:29,190
it leads to a conflict,a disagreement,disease in a relationship
这会引发冲突 破坏感情

577
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,830
However usually,not always,

578
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,870
but usually-that is a temporary disease.
但通常 这只是短暂的破坏

579
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,560
On the other hand,
另一方面

580
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,120
if you disclose over time and you open up and you share,
若你长期坦诚 敞开胸怀

581
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,930
that's when you lead to long lasting,
这会引领你走向长久的感情

582
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,060
positive consequences to the relationship.
对恋情是有积极效果的

583
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,880
So on the one hand,when you disclose,
一方面来看 你坦诚时

584
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,320
it's uncomfortable by definition.
肯定会觉得不舒服

585
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,490
If it's comfortable,then it wouldn't be hard,
舒服的话也就不难了

586
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,600
wouldn't be real disclose.
也就不算真正的坦诚

587
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,880
It's difficult in the short term,
短期来看这是很难的

588
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,360
but in a long term,it leads to growth.
但从长远看 它能助长感情

589
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,330
So the question is what do you want?
关键在于你想要什么?

590
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,230
Do you want a temporary feeling-good?-
要短暂的舒服感觉?

591
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,540
Oh you are validated; you are wonderful.
你被认可了 你很棒

592
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,900
Let me impress and show you how terrific I am.
我来让你看看我有多优秀

593
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,750
Because it feels good to be validated.
因为被认可的感觉很好

594
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,370
Or are you looking for long-term thriving
还是你想要一段长久而美好的

595
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,940
interpersonal friendships or romantic relationships?
友情或是恋情?

596
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,370
That is the question.
这是个问题

597
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,760
Now I said earlier and I spoke about it a couple of months ago
接下来的话我几个月前就讲过

598
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,650
and I want to repeat it:
现在我想再重申一次

599
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,160
how it changed my relationship with my students,
我是怎样改变与学生的关系的

600
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,320
how it changed,transformed my teaching.
怎样转变我的教学方式

601
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,490
Because when I started to teach,my main goal-
因为最初教学时 我的主要目标是

602
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,430
whether it was explicit and at the time,it was explicit,
不管讲得是否清楚明白 当时确实很清楚

603
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,120
but mostly,on the subconscious level was to be validated.
但潜意识里最主要是想被认可

604
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,290
I really wanted my students to like me.
我真的很想让我的学生喜欢我

605
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,030
That was my primary goal,my primary objective.
那是我的主要目标

606
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,780
Over time,as David Schnarch specifically
慢慢的 看了很多人的著作

607
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,460
as well as looking other people's work
尤其是David Schnarch的书

608
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,730
such as Parker Palmer's "The courage to Teach",
还有Parker Palmer的"教学的勇气"

609
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,730
my objective changed to be known.
我的目标变为了被了解

610
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,690
This is my mantra now.
这是我现在的咒语了

611
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,420
Everyday before I stand here and talk to you,
每天上讲台前

612
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,880
every single day I think about and read my mantra.
我天天想着并念着我的咒语

613
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,810
In fact on the first page of my notes-
其实这就写在我的笔记本第一页

614
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,320
these are my notes,my cheat sheet.
这些是我的笔记 我的小抄

615
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,420
On the top- "be known".Every day.
第一行字就是"被了解" 每天都是

616
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,020
To be known rather than to be validated-
被了解而非被认可

617
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,730
that transforms my relationship with my students
这改变了我与学生的关系

618
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,590
and my teaching for various reasons.
以及教学方式 原因有下

619
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:38,740
First of all,it's so stressful enervating to think constantly
首先,老是想着

620
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,210
"I have to impress whether it's with my romantic partner
"我得让给他们觉得我很厉害 无论是对于我的伴侣

621
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,680
or you know,650 or 1000 students".
还是一千个学生" 压力太大了

622
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,700
It's difficult.There's a lot of pressure there.
这样很难 带给我太多压力了

623
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,260
It is much easier to stand up here and say "OK.
而若是站在这里说

624
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,610
What I want the students to do is to get to know me better."
"我想让我的学生更了解我"就简单多了

625
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,470
And that means to get to know the field that
这也意味着要了解

626
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,890
I'm so passionate and so caring about.
那个我非常喜欢和关心的领域

627
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,970
I want them to know me better.So I feel so much lighter about it.
我想要他们的了解 这让我觉得轻松

628
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,970
I feel so much lighter about it in my interaction with Tammy,
当我想被Tammy了解 而不是让她有个好印象

629
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,160
when it's about being known rather than impressing,
让她认可我时 我觉得和她在一起

630
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,900
rather than being validated.
轻松多了

631
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,220
That's the first important thing.
这是第一个要点

632
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,010
The second thing about trying to impress constantly is
长期想取悦别人的缺点是

633
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:26,060
if we put on a fa?ade and act and then I tried- tried-
若我们带着面具 且不断不断地试着

634
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,910
if I want to be validated constantly,to seem perfect
让自己被认可 看起来很完美

635
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,740
so that the students really like me and approve of me.
以便让学生喜欢我认可我

636
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,410
But then what I'm doing is that I'm hurting the students as well.
但这样做的同时也伤害到了学生

637
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,940
Because if I'm good at it,if I'm good at putting on a fa?ade
因为若我擅于演戏伪装

638
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,490
and depicting this perfect teacher,
扮演一个完美老师的角色

639
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,950
I'm being a terrible role model,
我就变成一个很差劲的榜样

640
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,030
which in the long term will only hurt the students.
久而久之会伤害到学生

641
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,270
Because that thing doesn't exist.
因为那个完美的我并不存在

642
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,310
And if anyone is inspired to this perfection,
如果有人想向这个完美的形象看齐

643
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,960
whether in a relationship,whether on the individual level,
无论是感情中还是在个人问题上

644
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,250
it is inevitably a prescription for perfectionism
都不可避免地通往完美主义

645
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,750
hence for failure,hence for unhappiness.
也是通往失败与不幸

646
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,840
Or if I'm here to be known,
除非我是想被了解

647
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,940
which means my weaknesses,my failures-
也就是说我的缺点 我的失败之处

648
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,310
whether it's my failure in Cambridge,my failure here,
不管是在剑桥还是在哈佛的失败

649
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:24,270
whether it's the anxiety,then you'll see a real person-
或是我的焦虑 你们会见到真实的我

650
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,160
whether it's the mistakes,you'll see a real person.
或是犯错误 你们见到的是真实的我

651
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,410
And that's a much better teacher,
这样的我是一个更好的老师

652
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,060
much more accessible I hope than the fa?ade,
相较于那个完美形象 更平易近人

653
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,260
perfect to thereabout to be validated.
好过那个被认可的我

654
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,300
And again,beyond the fact,it is so much fun for me being here.
除此以外 这样的我也更快乐

655
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,740
Because what I'm doing now is sharing with you.
因为我在这里与你们分享

656
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,740
I'm sharing my part of self with you.
我在分享自己的一部分内心世界

657
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,100
And I'm sharing the field that
我与大家分享的

658
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,330
I'm so passionate about and care about so much.
是我非常喜欢和关心的

659
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,770
To be known,to be known rather than to be validated.
被了解而非被认可

660
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,620
Easier said than done.
说起容易做来难

661
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,100
But the benefits,especially the long term benefits are immense.
但是利大于弊 尤其是长远来看

662
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,110
Absolutely immense.
好处远远大于弊处

663
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:24,310
The third point is about allowing for conflict in a relationship.
第三点是要允许恋情中出现冲突

664
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,980
You see one of the misunderstandings about healthy relationships
关于健康恋情的一个误解是

665
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,600
is that those relationships don't have conflict- they don't fight
健康恋情没有冲突 没有争吵

666
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,270
The gold standard is a conflict free relationship.
五星级的恋情不会发生冲突

667
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,760
And that's a serious misunderstanding.
这是一个很严重的误解

668
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,610
John Gottman has done a lot of work in this area.
John Gottman曾对此做过很多研究

669
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,810
One of the things that he showed was that
他得出的结论之一是

670
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,870
there is not one right relationship.
不存在所谓唯一的标准恋情

671
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,460
And that also means different relationships look differently
这也意味着每段恋情看起来都不同

672
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,190
from outside or from the inside.
无论外人看来 还是自己看

673
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,570
Some relationships thrive and they are very quiet.
有一些恋情美好而安宁

674
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,590
Some relationships thrive and are extremely volatile.
有一些恋情则美好却激烈

675
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,500
Both can succeed.
两种都可持续下去

676
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,350
There is no one right form of relationship.
恋情没有统一的正确形式

677
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,890
There are numerous permutations and variations on this.
恋情可以有无数种模式及不同之处

678
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,860
But there is one right relationship,
但健康恋情都有一个共同之处

679
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,510
one thing that Gottman has found
Gottman发现的一个共同之处

680
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,430
is that in all those relationships-
那就是在所有的恋情中

681
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,420
whether they are volatile or very peaceful and quiet,
无论是激烈的还是非常平和安宁的

682
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:31,240
or somewhere in between,they all have conflicts.
或是两者兼之的恋情 都有争执

683
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,890
And on average- again this is average,
而且平均来看 只是平均来看

684
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,350
because you know it can be 10 to 1.
因为有些人可能是10:1

685
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,050
It can also be 3 to 1.
有些人可能是3:1

686
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,680
But on average,
但是平均来看

687
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:45,120
they have 1 conflict for each 5 positive interactions.
每5次积极互动就会有一次争执

688
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,690
Now it doesn't mean now going home and telling your partner,
这并不是让你回家去和伴侣说

689
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,400
"you know we've already had 7 good interactions.
"我们已经有了7次积极互动了

690
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,050
Let's fight."
现在该吵架了"

691
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,490
Certainly not that.But that is what he's seen,
绝不是这样 但这是他研究发现的

692
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,230
when he studied hundreds,thousands of thriving couples.
当他研究了成百上千的和睦夫妻后

693
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,290
That was more or less
差不多这是

694
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,580
the average of conflict per positive interaction.
积极互动与争执冲突的平均比率

695
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,310
This statistics by the way helped me a lot.
这个数据启发到我

696
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,460
Because whenever Tammy and I used to fight,-
因为过去只要Tammy和我发生争吵

697
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,860
and yes we do fight at times,I used to say,"oh,what's wrong?"
我们也会争吵 我就会说"这是怎么了?"

698
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,850
Versus "now it's OK.It's natural.
而不是说"这很正常 不用担心

699
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,870
Let's see how we can resolve it,
看看该怎么解决这冲突

700
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,060
what we can learn from it,how we can grow from it."
从中学到些什么 怎样改进"

701
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,290
It doesn't mean I enjoy it,that we seek conflict.
这并不是说我喜欢冲突

702
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,780
It's awful.And sometimes it hurts very deeply.
冲突不好 有时很伤感情

703
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,510
But at the same time to understand it's natural.
但同时要理解到这是正常的

704
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,080
And just like we give ourselves the permission
就像我们允许自己

705
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,280
to be human on an individual level,
有个人的不足之处一样

706
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,060
it's important that
我们要允许我们的关系

707
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:51,100
we give our relationship the permission to be human and humane.
存在不足 这是很重要的

708
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:57,970
People who have that 5 to 1 ratio,
那些实现了5:1比率的人们

709
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,850
again more or less usually have the thriving relationship.
基本上都有一段美好恋情

710
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:11,210
People who have a lot less than 1 to 5 ratio,meaning 100 to 1,
而那些低于此比率 如100比1的

711
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,420
the relationship in the long term does not thrive,nor do people
这样的感情并不能长久地美好下去

712
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:22,410
who have many more conflicts than positive interactions.
那些冲突多于积极互动的伴侣也维持不下去

713
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,820
So neither extremes are good.
完全不吵不好 经常吵也不好

714
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,550
The importance of conflict is that it immunizes us.
冲突的重要性在于它使我们免疫

715
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,240
Let's look at the natural or physiological level of immunity.
先来看自然或生理上的免疫

716
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,270
What would happen to a person,
若把一个出生的婴儿放入消过毒的

717
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:43,340
just born and put into a oxygen tank not- which is sterilized-
储氧箱 而不把他抱出来

718
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,460
and not taken out of that sterilized oxygen tank?
这个孩子会怎样呢?

719
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,320
What would happen if say after 2 years,or 3 years,or 10 years,
比如说两三年甚至十年后

720
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,350
that baby,now no longer a baby
孩子长大了 离开洁净的环境

721
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,040

is not to take away or eliminate the negative,

01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,420
So to keep these intimate moments
所以让争吵私下化

1011
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,440
that can potentially lead to growth private.
能潜在的让私密关系好起来

1012
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:48,350
Finally we can learn a lot from conflicts in gay couples.
最后 我们能从同性恋情中学到很多

1013
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,700
As I mentioned last time,
像我上次提到的那样

1014
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,500
John Gottman has studied gay couples a great deal.
John Gottman研究了很多同性恋情侣

1015
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,790
And one of the interesting things that he found
他发现了一件很有趣的事情

1016
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,880
was that they fight differently.
他们争吵起来很独特

1017
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,440
Now the interesting thing here-
有趣的地方在于

1018
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:07,170
it would not have been interesting if that was just between women
若是两个女人争吵　那没什么新奇的

1019
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,560
The interesting thing is that he found it also between men.
有意思的是 这也发生在男同性恋间

1020
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,030
Because women generally are better at fights than men.
因为女人通常比男人擅于争执

1021
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,570
And there is actually a physiological reason for it.
也确实有生理上的原因

1022
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,310
There is a physiological reason
这是有生理上的原因

1023
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,080
because men when they are attacked for example,
举例来说 男人受到言论攻击时

1024
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,840
or they feel attacked or threatened,or disapproved of,
或觉得别人在攻击 威胁 或不赞同他们时

1025
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:33,410
actually have a much more powerful,physiological response to it,
他们其实会有更强烈的生理反应

1026
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,560
which is why men are more likely for example to switch off.
这也是为什么男人通常吵着吵着就不吵了

1027
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,590
It's not just because they are men;
这不仅是因为他们是男人

1028
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:46,510
it 's because their real physiological differences there;
这是因为有生理上的差异

1029
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,340
where a woman,for example,
而女人 举例来说

1030
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:52,290
who is criticized,will feel it- no on enjoys it.
被批评时 虽不会喜欢

1031
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,810
But the men- again these are all average.
但相对于男人…这是普遍来说

1032
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,190
It doesn't mean all men or all women.
并不是指所有男女

1033
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,060
But on average,men will feel it in a much more intense way
普遍来说 男人对此更紧张

1034
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:03,960
and then will try to protect themselves.
他们会想要保护自己

1035
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,490
And one of the ways of protecting ourselves is by switching off,
而方法之一就是不跟你吵了

1036
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,310
avoiding rather than coping.
逃避 而不是应对

1037
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,670
Whereas women are much more comfortable
而女人对争吵更适应

1038
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,660
even on the physiological level-
甚至是生理上的更适应

1039
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,350
I'm not talking about the interpretation of that physiology.
我不是说心理所反映的生理感受

1040
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,610
But on the physiological level,
而是说单纯的生理层面上

1041
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,970
they are much more comfortable handling and dealing
女人更善于处理应对

1042
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:27,750
with this disease or discomfort of an argument.
这种争执的弊端及不适

1043
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,240
So the first thing is to know it,
所以首先要知道的是

1044
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,850
whether you are a man and you understand- I shouldn't switch.
无论你是否是男人 你要明白你不该逃避

1045
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,570
I know I'm uncomfortable.It's part of my nature.I accept it.
我知道我不舒服 这是天生的 要接受

1046
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,320
And then you can cope rather than avoid.
接着你便能处理 而非避免

1047
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:44,750
Or with women,to have more empathy and understand that
而女人 要明白

1048
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:48,960
their partner's experience is not the same as their experience.
她们的伴侣与自己的感触不同

1049
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,280
But here is the interesting thing- in gay couples,men or women,
但这里有意思的是 在同性恋情中

1050
01:03:55,610 --> 01:04:00,020
we see an enhanced,a better ability to disagree.
男女同性恋 都能更好应对分歧

1051
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,650
For example,how do they do it? First thing,
他们怎么做呢? 第一

1052
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,740
more positive,more humor,more affection,more touching,

1053
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,880
whether it's the men or women.
无论是男的还是女的同性恋者

1054
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,480
And that helps to dissolve,

to relax some of the tension that exists.

1056
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,690
Again,both for men and for women couples.

The negativity is less often taken personally.

1058
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,940
So even if there is a serious disagreement- well,

1059
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,630
I understand this is a part of growth.

rather than the affective,emotional,contempt level?

1152
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,430
And unfortunately,that happens to most relationships.
不幸的是 这种情形常发生

1153
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,950
Because we begin to take it for granted.
因为我们开始把好的东西视为理所当然

1154
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,740
And if we take for granted a relationship,it withers and dies.
而当我们这么做时 恋情就会消逝

1155
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,040
If we take for granted our own potential,
若我们将自己的潜力看做理所应当

1156
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:05,140
that potential withers and dies.
那潜力会衰减乃至消亡

1157
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:08,660
So benefit finding is important in a relationship.
所以说优点感知 对一段恋情很重要

1158
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,800
To focus on the discipline of my partner
欣赏伴侣的自律

1159
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,350
rather than on the rigidity.
而不是把自律看成固执

1160
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,310
To focus on their sense of humor
欣赏伴侣的幽默感

1161
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:21,570
rather than look at it as frivolous.
而不是把幽默看成耍滑头

1162
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,480
Focusing on the good; focusing on what works.
把注意力放在优点上 放在顺利的地方上

1163
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,660
And that is then accentuated.
这些优点就会加强

1164
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:32,050
However successful thriving couples take this step further.
然而成功的幸福伴侣做得更好

1165
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,340
They are not just benefit finders;
他们不仅是优点感知者

1166
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,520
they have what Sandra Murray calls,positive illusions.
他们还有Sandra Murray所说的积极错觉

1167
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,140
In other words,
换言之

1168
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:46,720
they think of their partner more than other people think of them.
他们认为伴侣要比别人眼中还要好

1169
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:51,850
So the experiment that Sandra Murray did was the following:
Sandra Murray做的实验如下

1170
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:57,210
she asked couples to evaluate one another's strengths
她让情侣们评价另一半的优点

1171
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:59,060
and then she asked other people
然后她再去叫那些

1172
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:04,800
who are close to these two partners to evaluate their strengths.
与他们相熟的人们 评价他们的优点

1173
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:13,300
And what she found was that couples who evaluated accurately,
她发现那些准确地评价对方的情侣

1174
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:17,650
meaning they evaluated their partner in the same way as others-
也就是与朋友家人的评价差不多的

1175
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:23,630
friends,family members evaluated them- they were OK.
他们的感情还算说得过去

1176
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,140
They were OK together.
他们在一起过得凑和

1177
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:30,910
Couples who evaluated one another's strengths on a lower level,
那些对伴侣优点评价得比别人还差的

1178
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,300
meaning they didn't evaluate them as good,
也就是他们对彼此的评价不如

1179
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,750
as strong,as powerful,as virtuous- whatever it was-
外人所认为的那么优秀 强大等

1180
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,200
as other people did,whether it's family or friends,
不管是来自朋友还是家人的评价

1181
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:45,820
these relationships did not last for long on average.
这些恋情一般持续不了很久

1182
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,560
Couples who evaluated each other at a higher level,
而那些对彼此的评价

1183
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,130
meaning as better than friends evaluated them,
要高于其朋友 或家人

1184
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,060
as better than family evaluated them,
给予的评价的情侣

1185
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,580
these couples' relationships were most likely to thrive
这些情侣的恋情最可能

1186
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,390
and succeed over time.
持续且美好下去

1187
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:06,130
And Sandra Murray called it- because
这部分人 Sandra Murray将其称为

1188
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,410
they were not connected to the evaluation of other people,
因为他们对彼此的评价与外界不符

1189
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:13,330
Sandra Murray called it "positive illusions".
Sandra Murray将其称为"积极错觉"

1190
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,520
Now- or another term used Brad Little used this term,
或按Brad Little的说法是

1191
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,920
having an "illusory glow" about them,
他们有着"虚幻的光辉"

1192
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,690
seeing them as better than supposedly they really are.
认为彼此远比实际上要好

1193
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,080
Now I agree partially with Sandra Murray.
我部分同意Sandra Murray的观点

1194
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,770
I agree with her that it is important to have these high,
我同意她说的 对伴侣有积极的评价

1195
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,220
more positive evaluations.
是很重要的

1196
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,290
The one thing that I disagree with Murray
但我不同意她的是

1197
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,420
is on the use of the word illusion.
对于错觉这一词汇的运用

1198
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:42,500
Because I don't think that is an illusion.
因为我认为这不是错觉

1199
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,500
In fact,it is very real.
事实上 这是真实的

1200
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:51,060
It is very real because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
因为这成为一个自我实现的预言

1201
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,390
And here I'm introducing a new term
在这里我引进一个新的术语

1202
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,410
in addition to benefit finding,benefit creating.
除了优点感知 还有优点创造

1203
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,910
Seeing things that were not there

1204
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:04,660
or the other people had not seen and then making it real.

1205
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,310
And think about in another domain.
想想教育界里的一个例子

1206
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,610
Was Marva Collins detached?

1207
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:13,690
Did Marva Collins have positive illusions about her students?

1208
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:14,520
Not at all.
完全不是

1209
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,600
I would argue the others,the other teachers were detached
我认为 是其他老师脱离切实了

1210
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:21,800
because they didn't see that potential in their students.

1211
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,900
Marva Collins was very much connected.

1212
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:29,270
And she focused on the positive and created the benefits.

1213
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,190
Abraham Maslow: "Not only does love perceive potentialities

1214
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,270
but it also actualizes them."

1215
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:45,780
Let me tell you a quick story about Tammy.

And as I mentioned to you,Tammy is a consummate merit finder.

and Tammy takes me for one of those talks that

those of you in long term relationships know about.
你们谈过很久恋爱的人就会明白这谈话是怎样的了

01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:23,020
And she says,"Tal,you know,this is getting really heavy.

1225
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:28,200
This is really difficult for me and I just need your help more.

You just need to help me a little bit more in the house."

And I said to her,"fine."

1228
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,380
I felt so sheepish and so inconsiderate.
我感到很窘迫 觉得自己很不体贴

1229
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,770
And I said,"I'm sorry.Fine.So what can I do?"
我说"抱歉 我能做什么?"

1230
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,520
And she said,"you know shopping this afternoon would help.
她说"你可以今天下午去帮我买东西

1231
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,110
I just can't carry these bags any more."

So I went to the Star Market.Filled up the entire refrigerator.

1233
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:52,260
Not only brought the things home,

"you know thank you so much for doing it."

So I did the dishes too.

Again,benefit creating rather than only benefit finding
