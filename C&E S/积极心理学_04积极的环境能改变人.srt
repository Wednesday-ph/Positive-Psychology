31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,890
Last time we stopped, we talked about how difficult change is.

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,770
We talked about the Twin studies that illustrate

34
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,480
maybe changing our happiness level is as difficult as--

and futile-- as trying to change our height.

37
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,880
that these researchers are making,

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,990
misunderstanding the nature of change.
误解改变的本质

39
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,210

the question is no longer "is it possible to change"

41
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,310
but rather "how is it possible to change".

42
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,880
And then we talked about the Somerville Cambridge study

to bring about change-- failure.

49
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,790
Not only they have failed in bringing about positive change,

50
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,550
they actually brought about negative change.

52
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,080
compared to the control group.

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,370
The control group that joined no intervention actually

56
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,230

61
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,400

for us, if our goal is to become practical idealists

is to understand what it is that brings about change and then do it.

64
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,380

66
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,710
Even if the research doesn't always communicate good news,

67
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,840
it's about communicating what works,

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,570
what is real, as opposed to our dreams ,

Good will, idealism, good intentions are not enough.

72
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,850
We need to be grounded in research.

73
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,050
And this is very much what Maslow has in mind
这正是Maslow的想法

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,220
when he talked about the analogous Manhattan Project,

甚至四个人度过美妙的一天

153
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,630
they pay it forward and make four others feel good,
他们会推展 让四人有美好的一天

154
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,270

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,600
Within very little time,

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,850
the whole world will be made to feel better.
整个世界都会感觉更加美好

157
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,040
This is the nature of an exponential function.
这是指数函数的本质

158
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,870
So smiles and laughters are contagious.

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,020
And to illustrate, I want to show you a quick video.

167
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,530
so that we can understand the power of one?

202
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,850
because people don' understand the nature of exponential function
因为他们不懂指数函数的本质

203
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,730
and therefore don't understand the nature of the power of one.

204
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,290

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,380
my dad told me about the invention of the chess game--

209
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,360
some of you know the story.
有些人可能知道这个故事

210
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,220
So the inventor of the chess game--

211
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,120
he was in India, and went to the local king.

213
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,640
"How can I reward you?" And the chess player said,

214
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,020
"No, it' OK really."

215
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,670
The king said, "No. I want to reward you.
国王说"不 我想奖赏你

216
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,070
How can I rewards you?"
我要怎样奖赏你?"

217
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,910
So the inventor of the chess game said,
于是象棋发明者说

218
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,740
"Ok. What I like is on the first block,
"好吧 我希望

219
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,310

在第一个方格上

220
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,540
I would like one grain of rice.

221
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,670
On the second, I'd like two grains of rice.

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,580
And the inventor said, "Yes."
发明人说"我确定"

228
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,620
So the king told his assistant to go and get the man,

229
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,480
give the man his wish.
去实现他的愿望

235
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,610

236
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,820
fail to understand it because we don't understand
没有理解指数函数 因为我们不理解

237
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,460
the nature of exponential change.

238
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,940
Another-- last one.
最后一个例子

239
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,080
So how many time do you think--
你们认为需要折多少次

240
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,450
you all have a piece of paper in front you--

245
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,040
so that you can reach the moon.

251
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,060
the person landing on the moon.
有什么大不了的

252
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,730
Seems quite simple to me.
在我看来很简单

253
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
And here is the point.
得出的结论是

254
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,740
We underestimate our capacity to affect change.
我们低估影响改变的能力

255
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,040
Because we underestimate the growth of exponential function.
因为我们低估了指数函数的增长

256
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,040
We are influencing people and the world every minute of our lives.

The question though is in which direction are we going to do it.
问题是我们选择哪个方向

258
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,960
Are we going to be a force for change? Be deliberate?
是成为推动改变的力量?深思熟虑？

259
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,220
Be practical idealists?
成为实践理想主义者?

260
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,570
Or just have the good intentions without the effort
还是只有好的意图但不付出

261
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,850
that's necessary to bring about a positive exponential function.

262
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,470
The final project for this course,

267
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,780
this is precisely what we thought about:
心中就有这个想法

268
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,340
how you affect change and those people whom you change
你如何影响改变 那些被你改变的人

269
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,500
will hopefully influence others and so on and so on.
希望能进一步影响其他人等等

270
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,360
In many ways, the idea was taken from the film "Pay it Forward".
从许多方面 此想法取自电影"让爱传出去"

271
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,260
What I want to do now is show you a quick excerpt--
我想插播一段片段

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,350
they capture this very idea of
深刻地描述了

276
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,390
human networks as exponential functions.
人类网络是指数函数的观点

277
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,130
We underestinmate our capacity to effect change
我们低估了自己影响改变的能力

278
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,890
because we underestimate the growth of an exponential function
因为我们低估了指数函数的增长

279
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,420
What if the world is just a big disappointment?
如果世界只是个巨大的失望会怎样?

280

And he walked out.

It was the best advice

00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,050
that my wife and I got regarding child-rearing.

898
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,490
Why? Let me give you an example.

899
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,290
So after about a month,
一个月后

900
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,280
I started to, once in a while,
我开始偶尔

901
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,770
experience some envy toward David.

902
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,470
Because here he was for the first time in--

903
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,380
well, since my wife and I were together--
第一次有人夹在中间

904
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,390
someone else is getting much more attention than I was,

905
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,300

And I felt envy toward him and five minutes later,

I experienced this most intense love toward him--

It's just something is wrong:

912
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:38,650
one minute you are envious and the next minute you experience love?"

913
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,680
There is nothing wrong.

It's part of being human.

916
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,850
And because I had Dr.Shapiro's voice at back of my mind--

917
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,450

918
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,520

00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:13,180
this is work done by our very own Daniel Wegner on ironic processing.

925
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,700
When we suppress a natural phenomenon,
当我们压抑一种自然现象时

926
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,510
that phenomenon only strengthens.
那种现象只会加强

927
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,640
Let me illustrate through an experiment.
我用一个实验加以说明

928
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,970
So for the next ten seconds,
在接下来的十秒钟里

929
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,760
do not think of a pink elephant.
不要想粉色大象

With the big ears, Dumbo?

00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,570
Do not think of a pink elephant for the next three seconds

and I am sure no one thought of a pink elephant right?

935
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,190
What happened? -- Most people thought of a pink elephant.
事实如何?多数人都会想粉色大象

936
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,520
Because when we try to suppress a natural phenomenon
因为当我们企图压抑一种自然现象时

937
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,330
such as having a visual of the word when we say it,
比如提起一个词时浮现出相应形象

938
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,900
that thing just intensifies.
只会加强它

939
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:02,040
The same applies to the painful emotions that are natural.
压抑自然的痛苦情绪也有此效果

940
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,030
And when we try to suppress them, they strengthen.
企图压制它们时 它们会加强

941
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,670
When I started to teach after hearing about

942
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,000
Marva Collins and deciding teaching is my calling,

943
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,160
I knew that I had to deal with the problem--
我知道必须克服一个问题

944
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,940
the problem is that I am introvert,
那就是我个性内性

945
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,540
I get very nervous in front of audiences and large audiences for me
站在听众前面我会很紧张 对我来说

946
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,370
is anything but five.

947
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,370

948
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,830
and I knew I would have to deal with it.
我知道必须克服它

949
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,270
So I would go on in front of audience and before

950
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,480
that I would say to myself,

951
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,430

955

And what happened?--

about paradoxical intentions by Victor Frankl,

I started to give myself the permission to be human.

961
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:54,860
And now when I go into a lecture, the nervousness--

962
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,570
because I give myself the permission to be human--

963

goes away within as little as three hours into the lecture.

964
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,210
But no, it's manageable.

965
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,400
I still get nervous before every single lecture,

which is actually a good thing. But it's managable.

Will you truly refuse to accept the law of gravity?

What kind of life would you lead?

981
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,190
Well, first of all, you may not survive for long,

982
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,860
if you truly don't accept the fact that things,

people being no exception fall when left in mid-air.

984

00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,950
let's the ground floor--

you would lead a life of constant frustration--

So instead we accept the law of gravity.

991
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:35,170
More than that, we create games around the law of gravity.

00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,320
I mean all those of you doing sports here--

I am not talking about Michael Jordan, but for the (?).

We accept it and we create games around it.

1000
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,900
And yet we don't do the same when it comes to our emotions.
然而说到情绪时 我们却不这么做

1001
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,820
Now here is the key point:
这是关键点

1002
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,120
Painful emotions are as much as part of human nature
人类本性的痛苦情绪

1003
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,940
as the law of gravity is part of physical nature.
一如物理世界的万有引力定律

1004
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,380
And "nature to be commanded must be obeyed".
"号令自然 必须遵守自然"

1005
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,180

00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,380
who wants to build an airplane has to obey,
想制造飞机 必须遵守

00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,760
take into consideration, learn it,

1008
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,030
study and understand the law of gravity.

00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,590

1012
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,380
And yet we don't do that.
然而我们却不那么做

1013
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,090
We don't do in our culture.
我们的文化不那么做

1014
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,100
And we pay a high price for it.
为此我们付出高昂代价

1015
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,220
We have what I called, "the great deception".
我们正在经历我所谓的"大骗局"

1016
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,130
We are people who ask, "So how are you doing?"

1017
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,990
And we say, "Fine. Just great."

1018
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,200
Well in fact, we are not doing so well.
事实上我们不是那么好

1019
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,440
More appropriate would be "I'm going through a rough patch now.
更合适的回应是"我正经历不顺

1020
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,520
I'm going through a hard time. I'm really stressed."
恰逢困境 我很难受"

1021
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,720
But yet, we don't want to admit that.
然而我们不想承认事实

1022
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,420
We don't give ourselves the permission to be human,
我们不准许自己为人

1023
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,200
because we think there is something wrong with us
因为我们觉得是自己有毛病

1024
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,920
if we experience these emotions.
如果我们有这样的情绪

1025
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:26,970
And then when everyone says,
每个人都说

1026
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,560
"Oh fine. Oh great. Oh terrific",
"很好 棒极了 妙不可言"

1027
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,530
then we are asked "How are you doing?"
当我们被问到"你好吗?"时

1028
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,510
I am not going to be the only party poop here.
我才不要作唯一的扫把星

1029
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:38,050
I am not going to be the only depressed one around here.
我才不要作唯一的丧气鬼

1030
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,150
So I said, "Oh fine. Oh great."
于是我说"很好 棒极了"

1031
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,880
And then we contribute to this great deception
就这样我们帮忙壮大了这个大骗局

1032
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,620
and it is this great deception that leads to the great depression--
正是这个大骗局导致严重的抑郁

1033
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:53,700
the great depression in the ultimate currency of happiness.

1034
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,670
This, to great extent,
这很好地解释了

1035
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:58,060
explains why so many people today
为什么今天有那么多人

1036
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,810

nationwide on college campuses.
全国大学校园都如此

1038
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:04,960
Not enough permission to be human.

1039
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,740
I am not talking about wearing our heart on our sleeves.

1040
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,040

在William James大厅的电梯里

1042
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,890
I says, "How are you doing?"
我说"你好吗?"

1043
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:14,880
"Thank you for asking.
"感谢关心

1044
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,240
You know it all started when I was three."
这得从我三岁时说起"

1045
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,360
This is not what I am talking about.
我不是这个意思

1046
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,980
In William James, maybe the case--
在William James大厅也许会遇到这种事

1047
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,380
because the elevator--
因为那部电梯

1048
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,210
it does take two hours to get there for the door to close.
运作得太慢

1049
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,040
But other than that.
但不是那样

1050
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,910
I'm not talking about.
我不是那个意思

1051
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,770
what I'm talking about is a space,
我的意思是一个空间

1052
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,670
a safe space in our lives with our closest friends,
生活中的私密空间 和挚友一起时

1053
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,600
with our family, first and foremost, with ourselves,
和家人在一起时 最重要的是面对自己时

1054
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,400
will we have the permission to be human.
我们要准许自己为人

1055
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,230
And what I'm not talking about is resignation.
我说的不是屈从

1056
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,790
Far from it. It's not about saying,
远远不是那样 不是说

1057
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,090
"Well I'm depressed. There's nothing I can do about it.
"我很抑郁 这是毫无办法的事

1058
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,120
I accept my nature.

1059
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,830
I accept my state.

1060
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,180

00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,360
I'm not talking about resignation.
我说的不是屈从

1062
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:09,870
what I'm talking about is active acceptance.
我说的是主动接受

1063
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,240
What does that mean?
那是什么意思?

1064
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,860
It means understanding that certain things
它意味着理解有些事

1065
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:18,580
I cannot change and certain things I can and ought to change.
我无法改变 有些事我能而且应该去改变

1066
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,770
One of the main ideas we'll talk about is the distinction:
我们会集中讨论的一点是"差别"

1067
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,360
we'll talk about specifically on the lecture on change
在有关"改变"的课上中会着重谈

1068
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,340
between affect, behaviors and cognitions.
情感 行为和认知的差别

1069
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,850
The A, B, C of psychology.
心理学的ABC

1070
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:39,330
Affect-- emotion. Behavior-- action.
情感代表情绪 行为代表行动

1071
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,870
Cognition-- thoughts.
认知代表思想

1072
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,700
Unconditional acceptance,
无条件地接受

1073
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,160
permission to be human relates primarily to our affect,
准许为人 主要与情感相关

1074
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,710
to our emotions.
与情绪相关

1075
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:57,280
They are there, just like the law of gravity is there.
它们是现实存在 就像万有引力定律

1076
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:02,040
That does not mean we need to accept our behavior and our cognition.
那不代表我们要接受我们的行为和认知

1077
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,600
For example, I can--
举个例子 我可以…

1078
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,260
and having the past experience--
因为以前的经历

1079
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,350
envy towards my best friend,
嫉妒我最好的朋友

1080
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,780
that in and of itself does not make me a bad person.
那种情绪本身不代表我是个坏人

1081
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,300
It's human.
这是人类本性

1082
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
I've never met a person
我从没遇到过任何一个

1083
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,490
who has never experienced or does not experience--
从来没有或没有体会过…

1084
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,730
well, maybe the Dalai Lama--
也许达赖喇嘛可以

1085
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,450
but other than that,
除了他

1086
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,380
who does not experience envy toward other people.
谁都嫉妒过别人

1087
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,600
And if it is true about the Dalai Lama,
如果说达赖喇嘛真的无欲无求

1088
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,550
that is because he's worked on it for decades.
那也是修行几十年的结果

1089
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,100
Envy is part of human nature--
嫉妒是人性的一部分

1090
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,090
nothing good or bad about the envy.
嫉妒没有好坏之分

00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,260
Nothing good or bad about experiencing the anger.

1092
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:46,010
Nothing good or bad about experiencing the depression or anxiety.
抑郁和焦虑也无好坏之分

1093
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,210
It's part of human nature.
那是人性的一部分

1094
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,110
However, the question is,
问题在于

1095
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,840
how do I choose to behave,
我要选择怎样的行为

1096
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,140
to act as a result of it?
去表达情感？

1097
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,810
That is where the moral domain enters.
道德在此介入

1098
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:01,070
That's where I can have moral or immoral behavior
我可以选择道德和不道德的行为

1099
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:06,550
toward my best friend or baby, or other people in general.
对待最好的朋友 孩子或一般人

1100
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,430
I can still experience envy toward my best friend
我仍会嫉妒最好的朋友

1101
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:15,820
and choose to behave generously and benevolently toward him.
但选择对他宽容和亲切

1102
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,710
The same with cognition and we will talk a lot about it
认知也是如此 我们会深入讨论认知

1103
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:22,160
when we talk about CBT-- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
当谈到认知行为治疗时

1104
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,770
I can feel it certain way.
我可以感受它

1105
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,710
But it doesn't mean that
但不代表

1106
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,560
I need to resign to my thoughts about that feeling.
我要屈从于对那种感受的想法

1107
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,280
Rumination is one of the things that we'll talk about a lot
我们会频繁谈到沉思

1108
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,000
actually not that helpful--
其实沉思痛苦的情绪

1109
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,710
to ruminate about painful emotions.
没有多大帮助

1110
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,490
It's much helpful to write about them.
书写描述更有帮助

1111
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,580
To talk to other people about them,
向别人倾诉更有帮助

1112
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,540
rather than just be thinking constantly about
要胜过总是想着

1113
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,000
how miserable I am because my girlfriend just left.
被女朋友甩了多么的惨

1114
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,460
I haven't found anyone in Pinocchio's.
我还没在快餐店找到新目标

1115
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,010
So rumination doesn't help.
沉思没有帮助

1116
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,400
So I don't necessarily accept
我没有必要接受

1117
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,810
all my irrational thoughts and again,
所有不理智的想法

1118
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,630
we'll talk about it much more next week of
下周我们会更深入地探讨

1119
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:07,300
how we can cognitively reframe what we were thinking.
如何认知性地重塑自己的想法

1120
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,970
But the emotion-- that affect is the emotion,
但情绪 情感即情绪

1121
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,260
it is what it is.
是无法改变的

1122
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,230
And the key is to be true to reality,
重要的是要真实面对现实

1123
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,350
which is also one of the main themes in the course.
这也是本门课的重要主题之一

1124
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,430
In many ways, this course should not be called "Positive Psychology".
从很多方面来说这门课不该叫"积极心理学"

1125
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:30,630
But I am telling you this after you already signed up for the class
我在你们选了这门课后才挑明

1126
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,110
so it is too late to leave.
想退课也晚了

1127
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,350
This is actually not a course on positive psychology.
这门课不是讲"积极心理学"

1128
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,680
It's a course in reality psychology.
而是一门"现实心理学"课程

1129
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,170
Because positive psychology may mean that
因为积极心理学可能表示

1130
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,620
we are only focusing on the positive and what works,
我们只聚焦于积极的起作用的部分

1131
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,660
ignoring all the rest that are not.
忽略其余不起作用的

1132
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,740
Overdoing this class is shifting the pendulum.
我们要做的就像是改变钟摆幅度

1133
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:54,070
So there is more even playing field instead of the 21:1 ratio,
比起21比1的比率 两方更均衡

1134
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:58,190
we are doing much more, focusing on the positive.
我们做得更多 除了专注于积极的一面

1135
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,640
And at the same time,
与此同时

1136
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,030
accepting the painful emotions
也认同痛苦的情绪

1137
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:05,350
are as much part of human nature as the wonderful emotions.
和美好的情绪一样都是人性的组成

1138
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,910
And sooner we accept it, the better.
我们越早接受越好

1139
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:10,960
That won't mean at the end of the course of 1504 or 100
那并不代表在1504课程结束后

1140
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,940
or 100 other courses in the workshop
或修读完另外100门课程

1141
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,580
and sold the books that you read,
然后就可以把读过的书丢了

1142
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,780
it's not that you will not have painful emotions anymore.
并不是说 你就不会再感受到痛苦的情绪

1143
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:22,100
It's simply your psychological immune system will become stronger,
只是你的心理免疫系统会变得更强

1144
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,900
hopefully already by the end of this semester.
希望在本学期未就见成效

1145
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,980
Psychological immune system will become stronger.
心理免疫系统会变得更强

1146
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,530
And that means not that we don't get ill.
那不表示我们不再得病

1147
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:33,420
It means we get ill less often and when we do get sick,
而是意味着我们更有抵抗力 即使得病

1148
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,930
we'll recover more promptly.
也能很快康复

1149
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,110
The difference between the extremely happy people
极其快乐的人和极其不快乐的人

1150
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:44,880
and extremely unhappy people is not that one gets sad,
区别不是在于一个会伤心

1151
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,720
of upset, or anxious, or depressed;
难过 焦虑或抑郁

1152
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,960
and the other does not.
而另一个不会

1153
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,330
Both groups do.
两类人都会

1154
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,470
It's how quickly,
区别在于他们能够多么迅速

1155
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,970
how promptly we can recover from these painful emotions--
多么快速地从痛苦情绪中恢复过来

1156
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,950
in other words, how strong our psychological immune system is.
换言之 我们的心理免疫系统有多强

1157
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,880
And our psychological immune system strengthens
我们的心理免疫系统会加强

1158
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,300
when we give ourselves the permission to be human.
当我们准许自己为人时

1159
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,640
Many of you've probably read this,
很多同学可能读到过这首诗

1160
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,390
come across this, but I think this captures
听说过这首诗 它非常好地阐述了

1161
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:17,230
so well the foundation of what it means to be actively accepting.
主动接受含义的基础

1162
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,560
This has become the official mantra in many ways of the AA movement:
它已成为AA运动的正式圣言

1163
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,130
"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;
"主啊 请赐我安详 接纳我不能改变的事物

1164
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,660
the courage to change the things I can change;
请赐我勇气 去改变我可以改变的东西

1165
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:32,300
and wisdom to know the difference."
并赐我智慧去认识这两者的差别"

1166
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,710
The wisdom to know the difference--
认识两者差别的智慧

1167
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:38,300
fortunately, a lot of this wisdom can come from studies,

1168
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,810
from research, from deep introspection that

1169
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:43,520
you will do throughout the semester.
进行的深刻反省中获得

I want to do a group meditation.
我想做一次群体冥想

1172
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,040
Trying to understand,
希望你们理解

1173
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,400
not just on the cognitive level of the research,
不只是在研究的认知层面上

1174
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,290
but also to experience on the visceral emotional level,
还要在内心情感层面上去体会

1175
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:17,880
what it really means to give ourselves the permission to be human.
准许自己为人的真正含义

1176
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,580
Those of you who don't feel comfortable doing it,
感觉不自在的

1177
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,850
you don't have to do it.
可以不参与

1178
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:34,970
Those who feel comfortable to do it, do it.
认为没问题的 一起来做

1179
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,970

I still recommend that you do it.

this is a wonderful opportunity to do it for the first time.
