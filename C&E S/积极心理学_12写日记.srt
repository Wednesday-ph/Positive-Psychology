And a couple of you contacted me after about this and said,

This is a theory.This is an outline.

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,020
what you do is very often mix them.

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,680
So you have preparation.Then you write a little bit.

And then you take a break.You have an insight.

Then you go back to more preparation and on and on.

41
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,570
This is just a general outline,which is useful in a few ways.
这只是一个轮廓 某些角度来看是很有用的

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,250
First of all,
首先

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,910
it is useful in that we can understand by looking at it.
我们光看着它就能明白

44
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,410
There's no quick fix.
没有捷径

45

None of the great creative artists,scientists,

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,710
business people in history,created in a vacuum.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,010
Initially they became experts in their fields.
他们首先得成为各自领域的专家

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,250
They worked hard.They immersed themselves in the material.
他们努力工作 将自己沉浸在知识里

49
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,050
So that's the first important element to remember.
这是你们首先要记住的一点

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,050
No short cuts.We have to apply ourselves.
没有捷径 我们得先付出努力

51

Remember the secret of success?

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,760
It's not just think,imagine,believe.

53
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,170
It also has to have the component of hard work as well as passion

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,370
So all the successful people...
所有的成功人士

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,240
Again,the best self-help books are biographies,

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,250
The second important thing beyond the importance of immersion

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,520
of the preparation is the significance of taking time off.

One of the first thing that leaders of today,

61
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,190
one of the things they don't have today is time.

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,210
It's the thing that they need most.

63
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,510
Time off to incubate,to reflect,to metaphorically,

64
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,520
or literally,sit in the bath and think.

65
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,220
That incubation,the idle time stage.

66
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,060
Remember J.P.Morgan's quote:

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,060
"I can do a year’s work in nine months,but not in twelve."
"我可以用9个月而不是12个月来完成一年的工作"

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,110
And that's when the Eureka comes.That's when the good ideas come.
那是要有所顿悟或灵感出现为前提的

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,380
It's actually after a good night's sleep.

70
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,250

71
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,980
It's when we in the shower.

00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,290
The next important thing,

component of this model is the evaluation part.

You know,there are many good ideas,

75
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,320
but very few ideas come to fruition

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,730
and actually become a good idea for a business,

77
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,470
or a good idea for a scientific paper,or a book,

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,100

and that's when the elaboration comes.
需要详细筹备

81
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,330
And these are no less important parts of the creative process.
这也就是创作的必经阶段

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,170
It really is about 1 percent inspiration
真的需要百分之一的灵感

83
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,860
and 99 percent perspiration.No short cuts.
百分之九十九的汗水 没捷径可言

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,070
So to summarize: the ABCs- the affect (the emotion),

you encountered before how difficult change is.

Sometimes programs that have been around for 5 years don't help.

Very often interventions were millions and billions.

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,840

who really brought journaling into the scientific realm.

it would be without a name- completely confidential.

So they were really able to treat it as their own journal.

And here was the instructions that these participants got.

you have not talked about with others in detail.

and touch those deepest emotions and thoughts that you have.

If you notice,you see the ABCs in it.

146
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,290
one of the first things he looked at was the anxiety level,
他首先看到的是焦虑水平

147
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,450
so when the results came in,disappointment.
因此看到结果时 他失望了

148
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,410
In fact,thinking of stopping the study,
他考虑要不要停止这项研究

149
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,540
because this is what he found.
因为这就是他的研究所得

150
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,570
So if we have this graph,this would be anxiety level.
大家看这幅图 这是焦虑水平

151
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,810
This would be time.
这是时间

152
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,140
He had a control group and the control group just wrote
他有一个对照组 对照组的成员

153
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,220
about anything that they wanted to write about.
只是写下他们想写的东西

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,530
Show no change over time.
随着时间推移 焦虑水平没有改变

155
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,270
So they started here,and they essentially,straight line.
从这里开始 一条直线过来

156
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,540
The intervention group,the experimental group,

157
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,190
after 4 days of writing about their most traumatic,

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,690
They started at the same point.They were randomly divided.

160
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,090
And then a rise in their anxiety.

161
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,380
After each of the days and during the 4 days-

rise in their levels of anxiety.

163
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,050

he was thinking terminating the study- very disappointed.
他考虑终止研究 因为非常失望

165
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,340
Because he got from personal experience-
因为他自己觉得…

166
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,000
he knew that journaling helps him and
写日记对他有帮助

167
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,820
knew other people who talk about it,who swear by journaling.
而也有其他人说过这一观点

168
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,530
But then,once the 4 days are over,during the fifth,
四天之后 从第五天开始

169
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,780
especially starting 6th,7th and on days,

奇怪的事发生了

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,410
Their anxiety levels went down.

172

they continue to go down.

they stabilized below the previous level.
在原来的水平之下保持稳定

176
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,600

178
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,330
over a longer period of time up to a year.

179
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,890
4 times,15 minutes- that's total of an hour.

That's very little.And long lasting results.

181
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,680
Think about it: this is also what we saw before.
想想 我们之前也知道

182
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,610
Sometimes,brief interventions are extremely effective.
有时候 简单的干预是很有效果的

183
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,270
Think about the shyness study that I spoke about last week
想想我上周说过的害羞研究

184
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,830
after 12 sessions of 12 minutes with women

187
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,080
So change can come in a relatively brief period of time

if we know how to intervene.

And journaling is one of these interventions.
而日记就是其中的一种干预方式

190
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,410
Now this is not going to be one of your response paper-
我不会要你们写这个作业

191
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,970
it's too personal.

192
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,690
I don't think it's appropriate to assign it,
我觉得不该布置给你们

193
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,390
but I certainly do recommend that you do it.

Do it on 4 days,15 minutes,20 minutes each time,

just write whatever comes to mind.
想到什么写什么

198
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,370
So it was reducing anxiety over time.
一段时间之后可以降低你们的焦虑感

199
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,150
Other results of the study-
这项研究的其他结果

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,060

They became healthier.

So over the year of the study,they visited the doctor's office,

205
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,660
compared to a control group,far less.

In other words,it strengthened their immune system,

They were happier,more jovial,more benefit finders,

213
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,500
Now why is that? We talked about it often that positive emotions
为什么会这样呢 我们说过积极情感

214
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,390
and painful emotions flow through the same pipeline.
和痛苦情感都来自同一个输送通道

215
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,530
And if we suppress something,if we stop something,

216
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,850
which is painful,we are very often indirectly,

217
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,520
inadvertently also suppressing the positive emotions,
同时无意中抑制一些积极的情感

218
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,850
whereas here they open up,quite literally open up

219
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,330
and allow these emotions to flow through them.

220
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,010
They are essentially opening up a clogged channel-

a clogged channel through which emotions,

painful as well as positive emotions normally flow.

They are more open,more generous,

as we saw also when you do the gratitude exercise.

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,280
There were gender differences,which is interesting.

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,460
Now both sexes benefited from it.

229
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,010
However,men benefited more than women.
但男士比女士受益更多

230
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,570
Think about it.
试想一下

Why do you think that is? It makes sense,if you think about it.

232
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,960
Women benefited significantly got better,

but men benefited even more.
但男士受益更多

234
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,690
Why? Because women have,generally speaking- again,

235
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,110
this is brush stroke stereotype-
这是千遍一律的说法

236
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,900
but generally speaking,women open up more.

239
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,680
Men still in our culture today are much more close

240
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,280
because it's not cool to open up.

242
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,960
especially when others are listening.

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,940
so women generally in their lives
因此 在生活中 女士们

244
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,320
比男士们更容易获得支持

245

I mentioned months ago,the beginning of the course,

which said women generally,again these are all averages,
提到一般来说 女人

250
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,610

women- or rather men benefit more from marriage than women.

Because women already have the supports system in place.

255
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,840
who they feel comfortably enough opening up to.Again,

256
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,810
both males and females benefit from a long-term relationship,
尽管男女都在长期的恋爱关系中获益

257
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,860
but men generally tend to benefit more than women.

258
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,970

Here is another study,which took the exact opposite approach.

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,210
and experienced more happiness.
让他们体验更多快乐

293
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,660
So both psychological and physiological results.
不论心理还是身体上都得到同样的效果

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,230
Now when you look at this,some of you may be thinking that
现在来看 你们有些人可能会想

295
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,450
"well,what about the Lyubomirsky study?"
"那Lyubomirsky的研究呢"

296
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,920
Remember the Lyubomirsky study?
还记得Lyubomirsky的研究吗?

297
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,470
That said when you write about positive emotions.
那项研究表示 当你写下积极情感时

298
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,780
Actually you feel worse.
其实你感觉更糟

299
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,310
Whereas you write about negative emotions,
而写下负面情感

300
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,100
you do feel better as Pennebaker suggested.
都会如Pennebaker所说 感觉会好些

301
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,260
Here's the difference.
不同之处在于

302
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,600
The instructions that Laura King gave were mostly,
Laura King的做法主要是…

303
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,300
were mostly about describing and re-experiencing,
描述和重新体验

304
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,110
replaying your experience.
重现你的经历

305
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,870
It wasn't about analyzing "why did it happen","how did it"...
而不是分析"怎么会发生这种情况"

306
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,870
It was rather how it happen- in other words,replaying it.
而是它的发生过程 就是重现

307
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,370
When the instructions-
当做法…

308
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,660
and this is the Lyubomirsky study- were analyze the experience:
而Lyubomirsky的研究是分析这种经历

309
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,220
why it happened,how did you get there and so on and so on.
为什么会发生 你为什么会遇上之类的

310
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,620
That's why it had the negative consequences over time,
这就是为什么随着时间推移 会产生负面的效果

311
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,430
but just replaying the experience,
但只是重现经历

312
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,480
just writing about how wonderful it is,
只写下这次经历有多美好

313
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,970
re-experiencing emotionally what that was-
重新体验当时的情感

314
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,010
that actually let you benefit.
实际上会让你受益

315
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,300
Now the interesting question is why.
有趣的问题是为什么

316
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,030
Why are there such remarkable benefits to journaling?
为什么写日记能产生如此显著的好处?

317
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,970
Let's understand the process,the mechanism.
我们来理解一下这个过程 当中的原理

318
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,720
So there are a few things that are at play here.
现在有几件事情在这里起作用

319
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,510
One of the things for example with positive emotions is that
例如你带着积极情感

320
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,000
when you are replaying it,you are simply,
在回想其中一次经历

321
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,470
you are fortifying the neural pathways.
你其实是在增强神经通路

322
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,870
You replay,you imagine it again
你再次重现 想象它

323
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,450
and you make it more likely to happen again.
让它像重新发生一样

324
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,640
Just like when you have a river,
就像你面前有条河

325
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,980
remember the analogy from two weeks ago,you have a river,
记得两周前的类推法吗 你面前有条河

326
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,590
and the more water go through it,then the wider it becomes,
流过的水越多 它就变得越宽阔

327
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,940
and then the more water is likely to go into it.
然后越来越多水流进去

328
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,810
That's self-reinforcing nature of change.
这是变化的本质 自我实现

329
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,000
So the first thing,
因此

330
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,620
the first reason why writing especially about painful emotions
为什么写下 尤其是痛苦情感

331
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,790
but not just painful emotions,
但也不只是痛苦情感

332
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,490
the reason why it helps is because of tension.
之所以有所帮助是因为紧张感

333
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,360
We talked about ironic processing- Daniel Wegner's work from here
我们之前讲过Daniel Wegner的"反语处理"

334
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,290
And what he talks about is that
而他谈到…

335
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,670
when we suppress unnatural phenomenon,it often intensifies.
当我们抑制非自然现象时 通常会适得其反

336
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,660
Be it thinking about a pink elephant
比如想像一头粉红色的大象

337
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,870
or be it suppressing painful emotions.
或抑制痛苦的情感

338
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,340
And when we give ourselves the permission to be human,
当我们准许自己为人

339
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,760
we are much more likely to release it,to let go,
我们都倾向于释放感情 放开心胸

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,110
which is why therapy helps,which is why sharing with friends,
这就是治疗产生作用的原因 就是为什么和朋友分享

341
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,520
opening up helps,which is why journaling helps.
与人倾诉以及写日记能有所帮助

342
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,530
This is the whole idea of suppression or repression.
这就是抑制或压抑的概念

343
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,710
The second thing that Pennebaker talks about is coherence.
Pennebaker所说的另一件事是关联性

344
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,530
One of the things that he finds is that
他发现的其中一件事是…

345
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,070
the individuals who benefit most,and he analyzes the test,
那些受益最大的人 他分析了这个测试

346
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,730
confidentially of course,but he analyzes the test.
秘密地 他对测试进行分析

347
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,130
Individuals who benefit most from the study

348
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,370
are once introduced a lot of insight words,or insight phrases,

349
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,550
meaning by the third day,they are all writing
也就是说到了第三天 他们都开始写到

350
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,450
"now I see that" or "I understand that"

351
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,270
or "it just dawned on me that" or "I realize that".
"我突然明白了"或"我意识到"

352
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,900
Those who have many of these words or phrases in their writings

353
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,330
are the ones who benefited the most.
就是受益最大的人

354
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,280
In other words,

they've created a sense of coherence out of the experience.
他们已从这经历中创造出一种关联性

356

They make sense out of something perhaps

357
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,060
before that was senseless.
这些事情以前也许是毫无意义的

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,310
In other words,they created a story around their experiences.
也就是说 他们围绕着他们的经历创造出故事

359
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:01,010
It's no longer dispersed,disjointed,disconnected data.

360
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,040
Now it is a coherent whole.It's a story.
现在已经是一个连贯 完整的故事

361
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,110
Now I can deal with it.
现在我可以面对它了

362
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,390
And if you think about it,what do people mostly remember?

363
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,060
People mostly remember stories.

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,830
Why? Because you remember a story,

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,050
because it's one unit- it's a whole.
是因为它是一个整体

366
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,950
If I give you now a collection of,you know,100 random words,

367
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,090
it'll take you a very long time to commit to memory.
那你得花很长时间才能记住

368
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,310
I mean we all know,we all took the SATs.
我们都清楚 我们都做过学术评估测试

369
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,480
But if I tell you a story,

you are much more likely to remember it.

Maybe not word for word,but certainly,the general ideas.

Because we can hold it,we can grasp it.

as opposed to some dispersed ideas,disjointed words.

We want to feel that our lives have a sense of coherence

that we can make sense of them.

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,980

380
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,420
is the anxiety of not attaining completion
就是对不能完满成功而产生的焦虑

381
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,860
and not understanding a simple cause-and-effect explanation
和无法理解对一些造成痛苦困扰的缘由

382
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,950
for traumatic disturbances.
的简单解释"

383
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,530
Alas,we naturally search for meaning

384
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,320
and the completion of events; it gives us a sense of control

385

and predictability over our lives."
控制以及预知能力

386
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,750
Again,that's why therapy helps,

387
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,960
because we create coherence out of experience.
因为我们从经验中创造出关联性

388
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,810
This is why there was far less post-traumatic stress disorder

389
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,710
after the Holocaust after there was the Vietnam war.

They created a story around it,a tragic one,

392
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,720
but still there was a sense of coherence,as opposed to Vietnam

393
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,350
where there was just random flashes of experiences
对于越战 他们只有一些零散的记忆

without giving themselves permission,or without society,

in many ways,giving them the permission to open up

they could grasp.

The work of Pennebaker to a great extent relies on the work of

a psychologist who we mentioned on the very first day of class.

whom I consider to be one of the fathers of positive psychology,

403
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,580
if you remember,came up with the notion of "salutogenesis",
如果你记得 就会想起"健康本源学"

404
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,910
an alternative to the pathogenic model- pathogenic model,

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,810
that led to asking the question in 1980s with at-risk population:
让他在80年代时调查了一些风险人群

436
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,290
"What makes some individuals succeed
"是什么使得某些人

437
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,430
despite unfavorable circumstances?"
在艰苦的环境中取得成功?"

438
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,120
It was his question that made all the difference.
就是因为他的这个问题 改变了一切

439
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,550
So he did the same in his research
于是在他的研究中 他做了同样的事情

440
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,050
and asked about the general population:
找了一些人来做调查 问他们

441
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,380
"Who are the people who are healthy?
"为什么他们会健康?

442
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,130
And what is the origin of that health?
他们健康来自哪里?

443
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,930
What distinguishes them from other people?"
他们和其他人有何不同?"

444
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,560
And he came up with the notion of the sense of coherence
于是他发现了关联性的作用

445
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,460
that people have the sense of coherence about their lives.
那些人让生活保持关联性

446
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,650
What that means is that,
也就是说

447
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,890
he said it has three components that he researched and identified
他说他研究并最终确定的因素有三个

448
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,900
The first component:
第一:

449
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,720
sense of comprehensibility- I understand the world.
理解能力-我能理解世界

450
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,000
It makes sense to me.I see.I realize.I get it.
世界对我很重要 我看得到 感觉到 理解到

451
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,410
The world and event,difficulties and hardships,
世界 事件 困难 挫折

452
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,420
highs and lows make sense to me mostly.
生活的高低起伏对我来说是宝贵经历

453
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,290
Second,sense of manageability.
第二 管理能力

454
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,220
I can deal with it.I can handle it.
我可以处理得了 能承受得了

455
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,910
I have the internal as well as external resources to deal with it
我能利用各种内部和外部资源处理事情

456
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,290
as opposed to being helpless.
而不是孤立无援

457
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,170
This is a sense of efficacy,of confidence-
这是一种能效 一种自信

458
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,710
being able to deal with the hardships that arise.
能够处理突如其来的困难

459
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,720
So that's the second component.
这就是第二个因素

460
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,810
The third and the final component
最后一个因素是…

461
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,150
that makes up the sense of coherence,according to Antonovsky,
如Aaron Antonovsky所说 能够产生关联性的

462
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,240
is a sense of meaningfulness.
意义性

463
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,340
This was not in vain- this difficulty.
困难的出现不是毫无意义的

464
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,860
This disagreement with my partner was not for nothing,
我和伴侣意见不合不是坏事

465
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,690
because we understand one another better now.
因为通过这事 我们更了解对方

466
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,810
And we are even close,more intimate.
我们会变得更亲密

467
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,000
This failure was not in vain.
我们在之间的冲突是有意义的

468
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,110
I have learned from it.And I have grown from it.
我已经从中学习到东西 并得到成长

469
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,310
This mistake has reason- again,
这个错误是有原因的

470
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,530
not necessarily happen for the best,
这件事的发生不一定是好的

471
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,870
but learning how to make the best of what happens.
但可以学习如何在事情发生后用最好的方法解决

472
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,420
These three components are what he identified and replicated
他定义了这三个因素

473
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,610
in later research as the source of mental health.
并被用作之后的精神健康研究来源

474
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,240
To quote Pennebaker- to quote Antonovsky,a sense of coherence:
根据Pennebaker和Antonovsky的说法 关联感:

475
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,550
"A global orientation that expresses the external-
是"一种整体适应性

476
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,820
the extent to which one has a pervasive,
主要包含三个方面

477
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,050
enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that
对生活的感受性和信心：

478
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,010
(1) the stimuli deriving from one's internal
(1)在生命中个体感受到

479
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,590
and external environments in the course of living are structured,
来自内外部环境的压力

480
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,160
predictable and explicable (comprehensible,in other words);
是明确 具体 可预测的(即领悟性)

481
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,670
(2)	the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed
(2)个体感受到应对内外部环境压力

482
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,670
by these stimuli (internal resources and external resources:
所需资源是充分的

483
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,330
I can deal with it,I can manage);
可以利用的(即可控性)

484
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,090
and (3) these demands are challenges,

485
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,170
worthy of investment and engagement (it's meaningful)."
值得花时间和精力去应对"

486
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,400
Look at these three.
看看这三点

487
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,610
For all those who write a journal,
对写日记的人来说

488
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,380
I bet you can identify these three in your writings.
我肯定能在你们的日记中找到这三点

489
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,580
This is what a journal does to a great extent.
这就是日记所产生的巨大影响

490
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,730
When we write and when we really write about our experiences,
当我们真的写下我们的经历

491
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,820
our difficult experiences,
那些艰苦的经历

492
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,170
this is very often what comes up - have sense of coherence.
就必须要有关联感

493
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,060
I see.I understand.Make sense.
我知道 我懂 这经历是很重要的

494
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,380
I can deal with it.I can handle it.
我现在可以面对它 承受它

495
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,610
I have just found a path of how to do it.
我刚找到了一种处理它的方法

496
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,980
Even if dealing with it and handling it is writing a journal,
尽管只是将它写成日记

497
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
and finally,it makes sense to me.
最后 它对我的人生来说 是有意义的

498
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,710
It's meaningful to me now,whereas before,it didn't as much.
它现在变得有意义了 尽管之前意义不大

499
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,300
So if you don't have a journal,you don't journal,
所以 如果你没有写日记的习惯

500
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,520
it is certainly something that I highly,highly recommend.
我强烈推荐你开始写日记

501
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,170
Let me summarize the whole change lecture: the A,B and C.
我来总结一下"改变"这一课:A B C三点因素

502
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,230
The three are interconnected.
三点是相互关联

503
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,000
In fact,if we want real change to come about,
事实上 如果我们真的想有所改变

504
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,040
they have to be interconnected.
必须将这三点紧密连接起来

505
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,390
Why? Because habit is like a flood.
为什么?因为习惯就像洪水一样

506
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,830
And it's not enough if we just create a small nook
如果我们只是开一个凹角或一条小缝

507
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,440
or cranny trying to create a new habit.
是不足以养成一个新习惯

508
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,100
Because flood would wash it away.
因为洪水会将它冲走

509
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,190
What we need is the A,the B and the C.
我们需要的是结合A B和C

510
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,120
Implement these changes in our lives.
将这些变化融入我们生活中

511
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,290
And they are interconnected.So let me give you an example.
它们是内部相连的 举一个例子

512
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,870
Let's say someone who has low self-esteem.
例如那些自尊心很弱的人

513
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,800
Low self-esteem,the C- cognition:
低自尊心 C 认知

514
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,760
they don't think highly of themselves.
他们会小瞧自己

515
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,880
Poor self evaluation.
自我评价低

516
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,310
When you don't think highly of yourself,
当你瞧不起自己时

517
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,070
you are more likely to be innervated,to feel down,
就会比较内向 感觉没自信

518
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,840
not to be motivated,and as a result of that,that is the Affect,
更别说有动力了 也因此而产生不良影响

519
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,630
the emotion that you experience- not good feelings;
产生不好的情感

520
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,970
as a result of that,we are much more likely to do nothing-
因此很可能会变得碌碌无为

521
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,310
in other words,the B is do nothing.
也就是说 B是碌碌无为

522
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,670
Now through self-perception theory,
通过自我认知理论

523
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,170
the behavior then affects my cognition on doing nothing:
这种行为进而影响我对碌碌无为的认知

524
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,260
I'm not dealing.I'm not coping.I'm avoiding.
我处理不了事情 我逃避事情

525
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,190
And that lowers my self esteem,
这会使自尊降低

526
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,160
even more my evaluation of myself,the C.
进而使自我评价更低 就是C

527
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,300
And that leads to even worse emotions
这导致更低落的情感

528
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,310
and so on and so on and so on,in a downward spiral,
等等 形成一个向下的螺旋

529
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,880
until in some cases,we reach resignation,
直到在某些情况下 我们自我放弃了

530
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,040
or in Martin Seligman's words,learned helplessness.
或用Martin Seligman的话来说 就是"习得性无助"

531
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,610
Now think of someone who has high self-esteem,
现在 想想那些自尊心强的人

532
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,360
high level of self-confidence.
他们很有自信

533
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,260
I believe in myself.I think I can do well.
我相信自己 我认为我能做好

534
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,170
That leads to high level of motivation.
那样会导致高水平的激励

535
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,600
Remember what Marva Collins does?
记得Marva Collins是怎么做的吗?

536
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,570
The model that we talked about under belief,
我们讲过的关于信仰的模型

537
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,450
self-fulfilling prophecies-
自我实现预言

538
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,960
that leads to high levels of motivations,strong emotions.
能提高个人动机和导致强烈的情感

539
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,010
I'm energized.
我充满动力

540
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:15,730
And that in turn leads to more action- the B,the behaviors.
也反过来引发更多的行动 就是B 行为

541
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,870
Because I act more,I do more,I cope more.
因为我做得更多 我应对的就更多

542
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,840
I put myself on the line more.
我更多地把自己置于水平线上

543
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,930
I'm much more likely to have more positive evaluation of myself,
那我对自己的积极评价就会更高些

544
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,070
which leads to more positive emotions and on and on and on,
因此也会产生更多积极情绪等等

545
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,840
in an upward spiral.
呈现一个上升的螺旋

546
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,650
The spiral that Barbara Fredrickson talks about
也就是Barbara Fredrickson所说的螺旋

547
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,590
in the Broaden-and-build,the spiral that Bandura talks about
他在"拓延-建构"中谈到

548
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,820
when he discusses self-efficacy.
自我能效时所提到的螺旋

549
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,640
When we intervene,it's important to introduce,
既然涉及到这方面 就很有必要介绍一下了

550
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,360
if possible,all three.
可以的话 三点我都想说说

551
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,420
And we can start anywhere.
从哪里说起都可以

552
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,690
So let's take an example- someone with socialphobia,
我举个例子 例如一个有社交恐惧症的人

553
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,910
someone who is afraid to be out there,in front of people.
一个害怕社交活动 不善与人交际的人

554
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,430
One way to deal with it-
治疗这种症状的一种方法…

555
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,140
let's begin with the A,the Affect,the emotion.
我们先从A说起 就是影响 也就是情感

556
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,570
One way to deal with it is through medication
其中一方面是药物治疗

557
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,300
that goes directly to our emotions.
直接影响我们的情绪

558
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,220
Another way of dealing with it is meditation,
另一方面是冥想

559
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,140
which also affects our emotions directly.
同样直接影响我们的情绪

560
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,940
Some people benefit more from one,or from the other-
有些人比较适合第一种 有的适合第二种

561
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,220
depends on how extreme the situation is.
这取决于他的状况有多极端

562
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,300
But that's the A,the Affect.
这是A 影响

563
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,030
One way of dealing with it,behavior,
另一种治疗方法 行为

564
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,310
is through what's called in cognitive behavioral therapy,exposure
通过所谓的认知行为疗法来进行 曝光

565
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:39,180
which is gradual exposure to stimuli that create that phobia.
逐步将自己曝光在产生这种恐惧的刺激物前

566
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,370
So initially I'll walk,you know,10 yards out of my home.
首先 先走出家门10码

567
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,840
Initially exposure through the imagination
先通过想象来曝光

568
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,400
and I include it under behavior,
之后付诸实践

569
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,870
because the mind does know the difference
因为我们的大脑分不清楚…

570
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,440
between the imaginary and the real.
想象和现实的差异

571
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,880
So gradually being exposed to it.
逐渐走出更远

572
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,380
Over time being exposed more and more,
随着时间推移 曝光度越来越高

573
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,000
until I can go out to a mall
直到我可以去到一个商场

574
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,200
and not experience the same anxiety that I did a year ago.
并再也没有一年前那种焦虑

575
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,030
So that's through behavior.
这就是行为治疗法

576
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,760
Very effective- the exposure technique.
很有效 曝光的方法

577
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,730
And finally,you can also intervene through cognition in therapy,
最后 在治疗过程中还能介入认知

578
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,060
in dealing with irrational thoughts,psychological traps,
来处理不理智的想法 心理困惑

the three M's- "Am I magnifying? The extent.

For example,my successes in working with people.

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,930
Or am I making up? Imaginary scenarios.

My catastrophizing events when I can have a more realistic view."
本可以更现实地看待的事情 我有将它灾难化吗?

So that's my thinking about it,the cognition.

Let me show you a personal example of something that I dealt with

speaking in front of an audience,got very nervous and anxious.

More than any other things that I was facing.The thing anxiety.

So what did I do? Let me begin first with the C,Cognition.

What I did- I analyzed the situation in my journal.

After the C,I went to the A,the Affect.

And the Affect was for me physical exercise.

00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,850
through our questions to a great extent.

and my question is "how do I get over this wall".
我的问题就是"要如何越过这道墙"

851
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,350
It's not thinking about "is it possible or is it not   possible".
而不是去想"这是否有可能"

852
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,370
It's rather "how can I get over this wall".

但不只在宗教里是如此 看看这伟大的国家

The United States was declared into existence.Words have   power.
美国被宣布存在 言语有其力量

868
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,000
They have meaning,especially when the words are meaningful   to us

The connection between concept and conceive

is not just etymological,it is also metaphysical.

it is much more likely to become a reality.

What words do is essentially create an image in our minds,

especially when we imagine the goal.

878
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,530
It creates an image in our mind and the mind doesn't know

the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans:

905
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,130
Just like when you declare you are looking for computer,

So this is about success.Very well documented.

Some of your readings are related to this.

And I emphasize "properly understood".

928

Why? Because we know that attaining goals,
为什么?因为我们知道实现目标

929
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,040
the attainment of goals does not in
实现目标本身

00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,360
and of itself lead to happiness.
并不会带来幸福

00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,940
Yes,getting tenure will lead to a spike of my well being,

but very quickly I'll go back to my base level.

Winning a lottery or making a lot of money,or getting a,

but it will not lead to long lasting happiness.

936
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,220
So that's temporary- we know that.

937
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:21,700
So we know that attainment of goals does not lead to happiness.

938
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,000

it's not the attaining of a goal that leads to happiness,

Wonderful book on happiness came out.

952
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,420
as you know,I meditate regularly,
你们知道 我经常冥想

953
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,520

in the power of a lot of the Buddhist psychology.

955
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,450
However,the one thing that we disagreed on was goals.

That's the one thing we disagree.
我们意见有分歧

957
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,440
Because in Buddhism,according to many of the   interpretations-

958
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,810
not all,many of the interpretations,

that we will be completely present in the here and now.

00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,820
Now I think it's a wonderful ideal perhaps,

964
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,570
but what I argued and what I still argue is that it's unrealistic

965
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,210
As human beings,I do not believe-

maybe after 30 years of meditating for 8 hours a day, possible-

967
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,620

00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,910
And setting goals is an example of attachment.Because
设定目标是与外界关联的一个例子 因为

970
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,900
when I say I want to win this championship or I want to get an A-
当我说想赢这场比赛 或我想这门课考试优秀

971
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:18,680
in this course or I want to get a job in this bank,

972
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,780
this is a goal which means by definition
这些就是确切的目标

973
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,130
that I'm attached to the outcome.
让我与结果联系起来

974
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,010
If I wasn't attached,if I didn't care then,it wouldn't matter.
如果我没与结果联系起来 我就不会在乎 它就不重要

975
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,780
And I think it's not only important for success,

it is also important for happiness.
对幸福也很重要

00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,740
from some of the Buddhist interpretations
佛教的说法

on non-attachment of being in a desire-less state.
他们认为身外无物是种无欲无求的状态

However,where we are similar in our understanding

981
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,290

is to liberate us to enjoy the present.

984
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:10,880
What does this mean? Let's say you go off on a road trip.

985
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,550
And you have no idea where you are going.

to see if you are not falling over the stage;

the flower on the side as well.

or for many of you,I know,it's happening right now.

You have no idea where you are going next year.

目前对大多数人来说 还是没关系

1000
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,990
But after a while,you want to know where you are going.
但一阵子后 你想知道要去哪里

1001
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,700

1002
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,850
you have a clearer sense of direction.
你就会有更清晰的方向感

1007
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,660
When they actually retire,they become less happy.
到他们真的退休后 就变得闷闷不乐

1008
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,370
The ones who are happier when they retire are the ones
那些退休后更开心的人

1009
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,230
who actually set goals for themselves,
为自己设定了目标

1010
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,350
whether it's taking a class,whether it's learning something new,
或是上一门课 或是学新知识

1011
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:34,530
whether it's spending more time with family and friends,
或是和亲人朋友相处更久

1012
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,910
but they have a goal,
他们都有一个目标

1013
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,960
as opposed to "let's just enjoy ourselves; let's just be".
而不是"让我们享受生活吧 顺其自然"

1014
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:45,330
We need that goal- this outcome,this future orientation,
我们需要目标 结果 未来的导向

1015
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,550
so that we can enjoy the present more.
那样我们就能更享受此刻

1016
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:53,540
The goals liberate us to enjoy the here and now.
目标让我们得到解放 才能享受当下

1017
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,920
In other words,
换言之

1018
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,750
if you think about it,the role of goals is actually means.
如果你仔细想想 目标是一种手段

1019
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:06,120
They are means toward an end,
它们是达到结果的一种手段

1020
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,890
and the end are the present experiences.
结果就是当下的体验

1021
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,490
Again,the goals in themselves,
再次强调 目标本身

1022
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:14,730
as we said,as we discussed,will not make us happier,
如我们所说的 并不能让我们感到更幸福

1023
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:20,730
whether attaining of the goal or failing to attain the goal.
无论我们是否能实现这目标

1024
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,210
We'll be on the ups and downs,the vicissitudes.
我们会经历人生起伏

1025
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,610
But if we want the base level- the base level is the here and now
但如果我们想要基础水平 此刻就是了

1026
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,250
The present.It's the process.
当下 就是这过程

1027
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,670
It's the journey that we're living mostly,not the outcome.
是我们正经历着的旅程 而不是结果

1028
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,420
When I start the book,
在书中一开始的地方

1029
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,500
I talk about thinking this rally championship would make me   happy
我谈及 冠军赛会让我开心

1030
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:47,120
And it did.For 4 hours.And then back again to base level.
的确让我开心了四小时 但之后我又回到基础水平

1031
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,950
Professors who get tenures think that is
获得终身职位的教授以为

1032
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,550
what would make them happy for the rest of their lives-
这事会让他们余生都快乐

1033
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,110
the attainment of that goal.
那个目标的实现

1034
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,090
It doesn't.
其实不然

1035
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,370
They go back to base level of happiness,

1036
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,630
whether they get it,or don't get it.
无论他们是否实现了这个目标

1037
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,430
The key is to learn,to enjoy the process.
关键是学习 享受这个过程

1038
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,830
And one of the roles of the goals is to liberate us
目标的其中一个作用是解放我们

1039
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,710
so that we can enjoy the process.
那样我们就能享受这个过程

1040
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:10,640
Goals are means toward the present end,
目标是获得结果的手段

1041
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,630
which is taking a lot of goal theory and turning it around.
这与许多目标理论背道而驰

1042
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:23,930
This explains why so many high achievers are unhappy.
这解释了为什么如此多的成功者不快乐

1043
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,560
This explains why so many high achievers

1044
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,820
turn to drugs and to alcohol.
沉沦于药品及酒精

1045
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,120
By the way,today even more so than in the past-
如今这样的人比以前更多

1046
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,790
maybe today we know about it more than in the past.

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,220
Going into rehab centers constantly.

01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:46,510
Coming out and going back.

01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,260
And we ask ourselves,"why? How could it be?"
我们问"为什么会这样?"

1050
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,690
Those people who seemingly have it all.

The life that most people in the world dream about.

1054
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,920
How come they end up in a rehab center?

1055
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,750
How come they are unhappy? Here's the how come.
为什么会不开心?现在就来说说原因

1056
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:19,920
You see,for years,when they climb up the ranks,

01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,250
when they have the dream of becoming a famous person,

1058

a person who is admired,revered,

a person who can get anything or anyone almost they want,

when they dream about it,they may be unhappy.

1061
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,460
But they say to themselves,

1062
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,720
"OK.I'm unhappy now,but I'll be happy when I get there."

1063

And then they get there.

1064
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,040
And they realize that there's no "there" there.
他们意识到并没有料想中的开心

1065
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,410
They think it would make them happy,but it doesn't.
他们以为那会让他们开心 但没有

1066
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,790
And that's when the real problems begin.
那时真正的问题才到来

1067
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,450
Because that's when they begin to experience helplessness.
因为到那时他们才开始体会到无助

1068
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,300
That's when they become resigned.

1069
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:06,460
That's when they go into- on the Hamburger model,

that's when they go into the learned helplessness

that once they make it then they'll be happy.

1075
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,800
And they are not any happier for it.
但他们并不为此而更快乐

1076
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,150
Yeah,initially when the fame begins,
一开始 当刚开始有点名气

1077
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,780
and when they start having things in their way

as they always dream,of course they are happier.

But then they go back to their base level.

1080
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,150
And when they go to their base level,they are suppressed,

1081
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,630
they are upset,they are disappointed,

1082
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,560
and more than anything,they are scared.
更甚的是 他们很害怕

1083
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:45,980
Because what now? Until that point,

they were sustained by their hope that when they get there,

they'll be happy,but they are not happier.

very often outside of the normal experiences,

01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,840
outside of ordinary life.

1090

And where is that? That very often is with drugs and with alcohol
那有什么解决方法呢? 常常就是药品和酒精

1091
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,760
Because that takes us out of our normal day-to-day,
因为那让我们远离枯燥乏味的…

1092
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,850
ordinary lives.For good and ill.
日常生活 无论是好的或坏的

1093
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:25,040
This misunderstanding prevalent and most people live that way.

1094
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,220
And they think- and this is why

1095
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,760
so many people go through mid-life crisis for example.
这么多人会经历中年危机

1096
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,120
It's not the only reason.But it's one of the reasons.
这不是唯一的原因 却是其中一个原因

1097
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:37,070
Because there are many people who are pretty accomplished,

01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,150
who have nailed it,and then they say,

"what now? Is this all the raise to it?"

1100
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,480
Yes,this is all the raise to it.And the challenge
是的 它就只能带来这么多快乐 而面临的难题是

1101
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:52,250
is to identify the treasure of happiness that are embedded,
去找出埋藏起来的幸福宝藏

1102
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,790
that are there in the it and that are there all around us.
它就在我们身边

1103
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,930
Again,happiness is not contingent on our status

1104
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,390
or the state of our bank account.
或银行存款的多少

1105
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:04,960
It's contingent on our state of mind,
它与我们的思维状态有关

1106
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:11,830
of how we interpret our reality,of on what we choose to focus on
就视乎我们如何看待自己的现状 以及我们专注于何事

1107
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:16,880
And to be happier is the present that matters much more.
想变得更快乐 当下更重要

1108
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,190
Quote from my book:
引用我书中的话:

1109
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:28,070
"Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain,
"幸福并不是登上山峰

1110
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:31,170
nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain;
也不是在山的四周没有方向地乱爬

1111
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,400
happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak."
幸福是向山峰攀登的过程"

1112
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,190
It is about having a goal.
它与设定目标有关

1113
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:39,480
It is about having a destination in mind,
与设定一个终点有关

1114
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,190
and then letting go and enjoying the process.
然后就释放自己 享受过程

1115
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,500
You know there are many people who talk to me about it,
有很多人和我谈过这问题

1116
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,830
and again I went through the exact same experience.
每次我都会经历同样的情况

1117
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,220
So OK "what is going to be the next job that I take?"
"接下来我要做什么工作呢?"

1118
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,550
"What is going to be the path that I take?"
"我该走哪一条路呢?"

1119
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,260
And once they take a path,it is very often they regret,
当他们选了一条路 通常都会后悔

1120
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,810
"I should've taken the other path." Should've taken this job.
"我应该走另一条路"应该接这一份工作

1121
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:06,650
Should've gone there.And my response to it is it doesn't matter.
不该去那里 我的回答通常是 这并不重要

1122
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:13,330
It doesn't,in the ultimate currency,it doesn't matter.
对终极财富来说 并不重要

1123
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,840
Because,yeah,let's say I am at a job that I should have taken
因为如果我接了一份应该做的工作

1124
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,690
and I would be very successful there.Fine.
我会非常成功

1125
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,770
I would enjoy a high when I became very successful.
当我非常成功 我会很开心

1126
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:25,830
But that in and of itself would not make me happy.
但那件事并不会让我开心

1127
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,860
The key is to have the goal.
关键是设定目标

1128
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,290
The key is to have the commitment
关键是自身的投入

1129
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,290
to whatever it is that I'm doing.
对正在做的事的投入

1130
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,770
Now that commitment may change every three days and that's OK.
就算那种投入每三天变一次也没关系

1131
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,690
It's the having the goals,having that commitment that Nmatters.
设定目标 全心投入才是最重要的

1132
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,670
So if you chose certain path and now you regret it,
如果你选择某条路 却又后悔了

1133
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:46,980
remember,it really doesn't matter.
记住 这不重要的

1134
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:51,450
You can be as happy in both paths as long as you are committed.
走哪条路你都可以开心的 只要你投入了

1135
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:54,150
Because when we are committed,
因为当我们投入其中

1136
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,510
that's when we can enjoy the journey.
就能享受这旅程

1137
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,370
Doesn't matter as much what it is that we are committed to,
而我们投入于何事并不重要

1138
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,890
provided of course that is moral
当然必须是道德的事

1139
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,660
and it's not about hurting others,
不能伤害他人

1140
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,650
which ultimately doesn't just hurt others-
因为那样的话 最终不但会伤害他人

1141
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,430
it also hurts ourselves.
也会伤害到我们自己

1142
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,690
David Watson in "The Handbook of Positive Psychology":
David Watson在"积极心理学手册"里说

1143
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,680
"Contemporary researchers emphasize
"当代研究学者强调

1144
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:19,270
that it is the process of striving after goals―
追寻目标的过程

1145
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,950
rather than goal attainment per se―
而不是目标的实现

1146
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,980
that is crucial for happiness and positive affectivity."
