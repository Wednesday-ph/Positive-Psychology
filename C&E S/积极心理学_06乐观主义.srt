10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,800
with some very important experiment such as the Milgrim effect,
某些重要的实验开始的 比如米尔格伦实验

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,600
or obedience to authority.
又称权利服从研究

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,750
Such as Zimbardo's prison experiment,

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,130
where prisoners were put in or played...

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,120
that after a week the experiment had to be stop,
一周后实验被迫中止

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,250
when it was suppose to go on for two weeks.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,270
And then the question we asked was,
接着我们提出了一个问题

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,850
OK,so we know that the situation is powerful.
既然环境的力量如此巨大

Langer and her research and how she show that putting
Langer教授以及她的研究

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,480
um...elderly men in an environment where they were actually
她让一群老人置身于仿20年前的环境中

00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,420
or where they acted as if they were 20 years younger

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,050
Improving their eyesight,improving their hearing.
视力听力也改善了

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,530
The distance between the bones in their fingers actually

33
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,060
became longer which is a sign of younger age.

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,960
as stronger and younger just because they acted as if

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,600
it was 1959 instead of what it was really was,
就因为他们装作自己处在1959年

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,910
which was 1979. The power of the positive situation.
而不是1979年 这就是积极环境的力量

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,920
And then she did another more research on

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,820
people going for an eyesight test,

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,030
they actually performed better just because of the situation.

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,040
And we moved on that what we ended last time
然后我们接着继续讲 上回结束的地方就是

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,270
by talking about priming. Priming is...
分析影射 影射是...

45
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,550
can be done in the conscious or subconscious level.
可以从意识及潜意识两个层面进行

46
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,640
It means planting a seed,planting a belief,planting a word,
是指在我们的意识或潜意识中植入

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,920
or a picture in our mind,consciously or subconsciously.
一粒种子 一种信念 一个词或一幅画面

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,330
And how that actually influences our behavior.
以及如何对我们行为产生影响

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,660
So Bargh,that time of NYU,
Bargh在纽约大学时

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,700
did the research where he primed to people
进行过一项研究 他用"年老"的相关词

51
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,760
with words associated with old.
影射实验对象

52
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,000
Words if you remember such as wrinkles,
如果你们还记得 这些词包括皱纹

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,120
words such as old,words such as Florida.
年老 佛罗里达

54
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,350
And as a result of this priming,
这种影射导致的结果是

55
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,070
those participants in the study actually walked slower,
实验参与者走路更慢了

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,510
or actually were more stooped.
更佝偻了

57
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,230
When evaluated by researchers
研究者进行评估时

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,350
who were not aware of their condition,meaning they didn't know
并不知道每个对象的实验条件

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,550
whether they were primed with control words,
也就是说不清楚他们是被影射了对照词

60
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,160
just random words,or with words associated with old.
随机词 还是年老相关词

61
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,670
So it was just through the priming that people actually
所以通过影射 人们的行为

62
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,020
started to behave differently.
的确会发生改变

63
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,990
The power of the situation. The power of the environment.
环境的力量 外界的力量

64
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,170
And then Bargh took it step further and said,
然后Bargh将实验更进了一步

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,180
OK,let's prime the with positive primes such as achievement,
决定用使用积极的影射 比如成就

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,500
such as persistence,such as success.
毅力 成功

67
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,100
These words,for example,
比如这些词

68
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,150
they had to find a synonym for the word achievement.
成就的近义词

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:07,470
Those who are primed with these words on intelligence test

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,310
and on memory test actually performed better

71
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,400
than the control group who wasn't primed with these words.
比没有影射的对照组好

72
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,920
Two Dutch researchers - Dijksterhuis & Knippensberg,

73
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,970
what they found was that they brought people,

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,230
and they ask them to describe for future experiment,

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,530
memory test after those primes.

how can we create a positive environment for ourselves,

Let me share a few.
我跟大家分享几个

102
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,330
In fact there's going to be your assignment for this week,

or one of the assignments to create a positive environment.
即创造一个积极的环境

104
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,930
So you are some of the examples.

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,700
Have pictures of people you love or places you love,the

importance of these things is that even if you don't see them,

they don't really see it,but it registers.
根本不可能看清 但大脑却记录了下来

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,030
or not really conscious of it,mindful of it,

by the way which is one thing that Bargh did it.

If we constantly focus on "negative" research,anxiety,

some of you may know,the Isenberg principle,

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,640
with the positive.
对自己影射积极的东西

conceive,and it will be conceived.

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,800
But,is this message right?
但是 这条讯息正确吗

253
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,430
Well,we talked about this and we saw the Roger Bannister story.
这我们讨论过 还有Roger Bannister的故事

254
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,100
You know one day,or six weeks after Roger Bannister runs
他在4分钟 准确说是3'59跑完了1英里

255
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:01,610
a mile in 4 minutes,or in 3'59,John Landy runs it in 3'57.9.
6周后John Landy将这一成绩缩短到3'57.9

256
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,150
The year after 37 runners run the mile in under 4 minutes.
一年后37名运动员都能跑到4分内了

257
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,110
So there is something to it.
其中有一定奥妙

258
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,640
Once they believed it was possible,it became possible.
一但他们相信能办到 就有可能实现

259
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,570
And here is the issue,
但问题是

260
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,280
with much of what's going on in the self-help today,
当今的心理自助运动的发展趋势

261
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,460
self-help realm today,it draws on a truth,
当今的自助领域强调某个真相

262
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,520
a real truth and then blows it out of proportion.
将这个真相过分鼓吹

263
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,260
So yes,
没错

264
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,840
there is some truth in the fact that our mind creates reality.
某种意义上我们的精神的确能创造现实

265
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,070
But that's only part of the truth.
但是这不是全部

266
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,150
We create reality or rather we co-create reality.
我们创造了现实 或者说是共同创造

267
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,900
There has to be something out there or in there,
还会受到外界或者内在的某些影响

268
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,130
for example,when it comes to The Secret.
比如《秘密》

269
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,160
If you believe that you are likely to succeed,
如果你相信自己可能会成功

270
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,610
you are much more likely to succeed.
那成功的可能性会变大

271
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,250
But that has to come with a lot of hard work and persistence,
但离不开刻苦勤奋与坚持不懈

272
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,050
it has to come with a lot of failure,
而且失败避免不了

273
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,440
and learning from that failure.
你要从失败中学习

274
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,290
So it's just half of the equation and what these self-help books
所以这只是等式的一半 而这些自助书籍

275
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,940
and messages do is overpromise and under-deliver,
传达的讯息往往言过其实 效果甚微

276
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,030
which at times can be destructive.
甚至可能会造成毁灭性后果

277
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:16,950
For example,if everything is based on the law of attraction.
比如 如果一切皆建立于吸引力法则上

278
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,260
I created everything that
我创造了一切

279
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,990
everything is up to me and also everything is my fault.
一切都因我而变 一切都是我的错

280
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,610
Even taking to the extreme,
举个极端点的例子

281
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,860
is a 3 years old girl responsible for being abused?
如果3岁小女孩被虐待 那是她的责任吗

282
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,160
Is a 30 years old man responsible for being paralyzed
30岁的男子被酒醉驾车的司机撞成瘫痪

283
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,820
as a result of an accident by a drunken driver?
是他自己的责任吗

284
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,140
There are certain things that are out there
有些事情是我们无法控制的

285
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,340
and when we say that everything is up to us,
所以一切因我而变

286
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,730

00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,080
from the medical school here,
医学院的老师

433
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,920
has done a lot of research in this area.
对此做了一系列研究

434
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,270
Let me share with you just two of his studies.
我着重跟大家讲两个

435
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,500
What Benson did was bringing women who had,
他找了一些处在妊娠期

436
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,820
who were pregnant,and who had stomach problems...
胃部不适的妇女

437
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,860
they were vomiting,they were throwing up,they were nauseous,
她们都有呕吐恶心的症状

438
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,500
something which is relatively common
这其实挺常见的

439
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,520
especially in the first trimester of pregnancy.
尤其是在怀孕初期的三个月

440
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,740
So he brought them in and told them,
他告诉她们

441
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,970
"I have this new pill for you
"这里有一种新药

442
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,860
that will help you overcome your stomach distress.
能缓解你们胃部不适

443
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,470
You won't throw up any more after;
治疗呕吐症状

444
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,760
this is a very powerful and good pill."
非常有效

445
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,930
So he gave them that pill and they got over
于是他把药给了她们

446
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,080
their stomach distress,they were better.
她们的胃部就好了

447
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,510
They didn't know of course this was just a placebo drug,
当然 她们不知道那只是安慰剂

448
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,050
just a sugar pill.
普通的糖丸

449
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,190
Then he took it step further,
然后他将实验更进一步

450
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,240
brought in another group of women with the exact
找来了另一组有同样胃部不适

451
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,830
same stomach distress,with the same vomiting.
呕吐症状的妇女

452
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,790
Gave them the pill,
把药给她们

453
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,460
he told them would help them overcome their stomach distress.
告诉她们可以缓解胃病

454
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,290
Only this time,instead of a sugar pill,
但是这次 他给的不再是糖丸

455
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,610
he actually gave them small dosage,
而是小剂量

456
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,360
not dangerous but small dosage of ipecac.
没有危险性的小剂量的吐根

457
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,660
Now those of you who know what ipecac is...
你们可能知道吐根...

458
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,930
It's a drug that we take if we want to throw up.
是催吐时服用的药物

459
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,590
So if we have food poisoning,
如果发生食物中毒

460
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,850
we take these drugs and it will actually elicit vomiting.
就需要服用吐根催吐

461
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,090
So he gave them this drug and again,
他给这些病人服用了吐根

462
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:45,340
this passed all the ethic reviews and was not dangerous,you know
这一实验通过了道德审查 没有风险

463
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,860
But that's what he did.
他给这些病人服用了吐根

464
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,150
And these women were told that they'd get better.
并告诉她们能治疗呕吐

465
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,540
And they did get better.
而她们也的确恢复了健康

466
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,510
Not only did they not vomit as they should have done,
本来应该出现的呕吐症状不仅没有出现

467
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,770
more so with the ipecac,they actually stopped.
由于服用了吐根更该呕吐的 实际上呕吐却停止了

468
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,130
Let me read to you an excerpt from his book,
我给大家读一段摘录自他的《永恒的治疗》

469
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,580
which I highly recommend,Timeless Healing.
我非常推荐这本书

470
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,600
I quote,"Remarkably,the patients' nausea
"引人注目地是 病人的恶心感与呕吐反应

471
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,310
and vomiting ceased entirely and their stomach contractions,
完全终止了 且根胃内水球测量

472
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,510
as measured through the balloons,returned to normal.
胃胀现象也消失了 恢复正常

473
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,160
Because they believed they received anti-nausea medicine,
因为她们相信她们服用的是止吐药

474
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,910
the women reversed the proven action of a powerful drug.
竟然逆转了催吐药的作用

475
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,080
Even though many of us stock our medicine cabinets and first aid
虽然很多人在医药箱储存了吐根

476
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,070
kits with ipecac to bring about vomiting in case of poisoning,
以防食物中毒发生

477
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,870
these pregnant women with documented stomach distress thwarted
这些胃部不适的孕妇

478
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,130
the action of a drug that should have made them even sicker.
却抵御了本该让她们更难受的催吐药物

479
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,990
With belief alone,they cured themselves."
单凭信仰就治好了病痛

480
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,850
Now,this doesn't mean that drugs don't have an effect.
但这不是说药物没有效果

481
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,430
You know,I don't recommend going home now and,
我不推荐大家回家以后

482
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,110
you know,giving your roommates,
给你们的室友

483
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,200
you know,ipecac or even worse cyanide
服用吐根 甚至氰化物

484
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,610
and then tell them this is actually Vitamin C.
然后告诉他们这是维生素C

485
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,320
they will probably not feel better or healthier as a result.
他们一般不会感觉好

486
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,760
But what this experiment dose,
但这一实验

487
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,450
and many others like it show is that powerful effect
及其他类似实验表明

488
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,890
of the mind which we shouldn't discard.
我们不应忽视精神的强大力量

489
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,750
We need to study it and understand.
而需要研究并理解它

490
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,690
Well,here is another experiment that Benson writes
Benson在他的书中还写到了另一个实验

491
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,720
about in his book. This was done in Japan.
这项实验是在日本进行的

492
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,800
So,people who are allergic to a specific plant
实验对象对某种植物过敏

493
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,690
were brought into a lab,had their eyes closed,and then,
他们被蒙着眼睛带进实验室

494
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,940
they had these plant touch their forearm,
研究人员用过敏植物碰触他们一只手臂

495
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,400
and then they had another plant touch their other forearm,
然后用另一种植物碰触另一只手臂

496
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,790
and they didn't know which was which.
但没有告诉他们哪边是过敏植物

497
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,260
And of course that plant that they were allergic to,
理论上被过敏植物碰触的手臂

498
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,870
the arm flared up. They were allergic to it after all.
会发出了疹子 出现过敏反应

499
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,310
But then,their was a second condition,
但是 实验还有另一个条件

500
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,130
these people were told that the actual drug(plant)
他们被告知会过敏的植物

501
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,920
that they are allergic to touched their left hand,
碰触了他们的左手

502
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,850
and another plant that they were not allergic to
不会导致过敏的植物

503
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,090
touched their right hand.
碰触了他们的右手

504
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,410
But Benson reversed the effect,
但是Benson将两者对调了

505
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,810
so actually the plant that they were allergic to
即真正会导致过敏的植物

506
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,830
touched their right hand,and the plant that
碰触的是他们的右手 而不会导致过敏的

507
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,470
they were not allergic to touched their left hand.
碰触的是他们的左手

508
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,860
So they were supposed to flare up on the right,not on the left.
所以按理说 应该右手起疹子 而非左手

509
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,310
But because they believed that the allergic plant
但是因为他们误以为左边的才是

510
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,130
was on the left,their left hand flared up,
过敏植物 所以左手起了疹子

511
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,470
their right hand did not.
而右手没有

512
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,150
Based on the power of the mind.
因为精神的力量

513
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,460
Once again,this does not mean that the external doesn't matter
但同样的 这并不是说外在因素不重要

514
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,400
and that we attracted everything that we want to into our lives,
也不说明生活中的一切都是被吸引过来的

515
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,970
but it does mean that the mind plays a very important role
但是这的确证明了精神

516
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,650
in creating our physical,certainly emotional,
对构建我们的生理 情感 认知

517
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,430
cognitive as well as external reality.
以及外在环境起了重要作用

518
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,230
Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies.
信念常常会成为自我实现的预言

519
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,960
But how does it work? How does it work?
但它是如何作用的呢?

520
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,900
Let me share with you this model that
我想跟大家分享一个模型

521
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,990
I created based on a lot of research in the field.
是我根据这一领域大量研究建立起来的

522
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,930
That essentially tries to explain how our beliefs,
它基本上解释了我们的信念及希望

523
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,490
our expectations impact our performance.
是如何影响我们的表现的

524
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,010
Whether it's through the placebo drug,
无论是安慰剂效应

525
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,040
whether it's our performance in school,in sports,
还是我们学习 体育运动 恋爱关系等

526
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,050
in relationships,in every area in our lives.
生活各个方面的表现

527
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,040
In other words,what comes in the box here?
换句话说 这盒子里是什么

528
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,330
Or in the...over here?
这上面应该有哪些内容?

529
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,790
What comes,what mediate between beliefs,
是什么斡旋于信念期望

530
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,510
expectations and actual performance in the real world?
及实际表现之间?

531
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,260
I want to talk about two mechanisms.
我想谈谈两个机制

532
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,560
The first one is very straight forward,
第一个相对简单易懂

533
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,760
relatively simple,it's motivation.
即动力

534
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,340
So,if I believe that I can do well,
如果我相信我能行

535
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,190
and think about your own past experiences,
各位可以回忆一下自己的经历

536
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,680
when you believe that you could do well in something,
当你相信你能做好某事时

537
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,170
you are much more likely to be motivated
会非常有动力

538
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,010
than if you think that you are hopeless and have no chance,
如果你认为自己希望渺茫

539
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,130
you are much more likely to resign and not do anything.
那就很有可能就此放弃 无所作为

540
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,350
You are much more likely to be motivated before
你不仅事前会受到激励

541
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,440
the event whatever the event may be,in training,in practice,
无论是训练 还是练习

542
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,860
as well as during the event,while it's taking place.
而且正式进行时也会动力十足

543
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,080
Think about what Marva Collins did.
想想Marva Collins的研究

544
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,600
She motivated her students,
她激励学生

545
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,180
she made them believe that they could achieve,
让他们相信他们能获得成功

546
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,210
that they could make something out of their lives
他们一生中能有所作为

547
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,730
and that it's their responsibility that it was up to them,
这是他们的责任

548
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,430
and that made all the difference for them.
这改变了他们的命运

549
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,940
Because they were motivated,they worked hard.
因为他们有了动力 所以非常刻苦

550
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,210
So motivation makes a difference.
所以动力非常重要

551
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,350
There is another thing though,in addition to motivation,
除了动力外 另一样东西也会影响我们

552
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,710
and that is the notion of consistency or congruence.
即一致性或相合性的概念

553
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,440
What dose that mean?
那是什么意思

554
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,590
You see,we all have a mental schema of the world,
我们每个人对世界都存在心理图式

555
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,790
a mental schema of the way the world should be,or to be or is.
世界应该怎么样 会怎么样 是怎么样

556
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,050
For example,I have a mental schema
比如 我的一个心理图式

557
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,130
that suggests that things fall when left in middle air.
表明把东西放在半空会掉下来

558
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,440
So I have a schema that says that if I dropped this,
所以我认为如果我放开这东西

559
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,140
it would actually fall.
它就会掉下来

560
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:18,150
I have a schema about my ability in mathematics
图式认为我的数学能力

561
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,080
that I might be a good mathematician,
我可能是个优秀的数学家

562
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,040
that I have potential in this area or not.
我在这一领域是否有潜力

563
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,020
I also have the schema about other people. I like this person.
对其他人的态度也有图式 我喜欢这人

564
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,070
That person is a nice person versus
那人真好

565
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,750
this person is just not nice,cruel.
还是那人不好 残忍

566
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,700
So we have schemas about other people,
所以我们对他人 对自己

567
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,170
about ourselves,about natural phenomenon.
对自然现象 都有图式

568
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,060
This is inside,the schema.
图式就是内在

569
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,310
And then,there is the outside world.
还有外部世界

570
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,650
In the outside world,actual things take place.
现实发生在外部世界

571
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,780
For example,when this is left in middle air,it falls.
比如 半空中我松开手 它就会掉下来

572
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,070
This is,has nothing to do with my schema.
这一事实与我的图式无关

573
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,190
It's outside. It happens regardless of my schema.
它发生在外部世界 不管我的图式如何

574
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,340
Now I have certain potential
我在数学上的实际潜力

575
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,180
in mathematics regardless of my schema.
也与我的图式无关

576
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,470
A certain person behaves generously and benevolently
某个人对他人

577
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,830
toward other people or in a hateful manner
是慷慨仁慈还是可憎无礼

578
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,310
toward other people regardless of my schema.
也与我的图式无关

579
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,250
So there is what's inside and what is outside,
所以内部和外部两个因素

580
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,670
and here is the key point.
共同作用就是关键

581
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,450
You see,the mind dose not like when there is a discrepancy
我们的精神不喜欢内部与外部

582
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,580
between what is inside and what is outside.
存在差异

583
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,710
The mind likes when there is consistency,
我们的精神喜欢两者一致相合

584
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,420
congruence between the two,and if there is no congruence,
如果不相合

585
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,140
if there is no consistency,
如果不一致

586
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,000
then we experience a sense of dissidence,
我们就会产生异议感

587
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,520
then we experience disease.
觉得不适

588
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,650
Doesn't feel good,doesn't feel right and we do,very often,
感觉不舒服 不对劲

589
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,680
everything that we can to get the two on par again.
所以我们常常不惜一切 让两者统一

590
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,270
Either by changing the external reality
要么改变外部现实

591
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,680
or by changing our mind to match the external reality.
要么改变自我思维以符合外部现实

592
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,820
We don't like when there is inconsistency.
我们不喜欢不一致

593
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,010
There are a few ways in which
有好几种方法

594
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,490
we can create this consistency again.
可以重建一致性

595
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,470
Let me share with you just some of them,
我给大家介绍几个

596
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,510
and I'm gonna share four. They are interconnected.
我会讲4个 都是互相关联的

597
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,410
There is relationship between. there is overlap,
互相联系 还有重合之处

598
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,400
but just so it helps you to think about it.
但这样能帮助你们就此进行思考

599
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,040
That helps you understand the dialogue that takes place
帮助你们理解内部与外部间

600
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,960
between what is inside or what is inside and what is outside.
发生的对话

601
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,620
So the first thing we can do when there is a discrepancy,
两者差异发生时

602
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:48,130
when there is inconsistency between the two is update schema.
我们首先能做的就是更新图式

603
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,770
This is the first thing we can do.
这是第一种做法

604
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,760
So,I didn't know things fell when left in middle air,
比如 原来我不知道松开手东西会掉下来

605
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,510
now I know,I updated my schema.
现在我知道了 于是我更新图式

606
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,740
Or,I thought that person was actually hateful,
又比如 我原来以为那人很可恶

607
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,810
but I just saw him behave generously and benevolently,
但我看到他们对别人慷慨仁慈

608
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,750
now I update my schema,he's a nice person.
于是我更新图式 他是个好人

609
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,730
The second thing that we do,
第二种做法

610
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,360
which happens much more often than the first one,
通常比第一种更普遍

611
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:23,440
is ignore or discard in external information.
即忽视或抛弃外在信息

612
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,560
We ignore and discard external information
忽视或抛弃

613
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,170
that doesn't match our schema.
不符合图式的外部信息

614
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,440
We don't like this inconsistency,
我们不喜欢不一致

615
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,110
we just throw this inconsistency out,
于是直接扔掉这种不一致

616
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,460
so to speak,by ignoring it,discarding it.
也就是忽视 抛弃它

617
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,780
The third thing we do,
第三种方法

618
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,580
we actively seek confirmation.
主动验证

619
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,690
We actively seek confirmatory data.
我们会主动寻求验证信息

620
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,510
I mean,think about No.2 and 3,think about in the real
想想2和3 想想现实世界

621
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,190
you know we are in the midst of election year.
今年正是选举年

622
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,370
Think about the person you are not going to vote for,
想想你不会投谁的票

623
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,780
or the person you didn't vote for.
或者你以前没投过谁

624
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,190
What we do? Very often,let's say,
我们是怎么做的?通常 比如

625
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,870
I see President Bush doing something good,
我看到布什总统做了件好事

626
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,540
actually fighting for a cause that I believe in.
为我信仰的某个事业奋斗

627
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,660
But I didn't vote Bush,for instance.
但我之前没给布什投票 举例而已

628
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,600
Very often what I would do is ignore
于是多数情况下 我会选择

629
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,190
and discard that information,
忽视抛弃这条信息

630
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,570
and then look for confirming evidence that will suggest...or that
然后寻找有利证据以支持...

631
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,710
will confirm to me why I don't like Bush in the first place.
坚定我讨厌布什的立场

632
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:45,210
This same regarding,say the future elections,Hillary or Obama.
这同样适用于今后的选举 比如希拉里或奥巴马

633
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,950
If I dislike them,I would look for confirming evidence
如果我不喜欢他们 我就会寻找相应证据

634
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,860
why I dislike them and even if they do things

635
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,420
that I like and value and believe in,
即使他们做了什么我喜欢 重视或信仰的事

636
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,000
I very often will ignore these things and discard them.
通常我会选择忽视

637
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,690
And what you are doing here,you are creating a reality
我们所做的 就是创造另一个现实

638
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,020
because you are asking a question such as
因为我们在质疑

639
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
where has Bush done terrible things or

where has Hillary or Obama did terrible things?
希拉里或奥巴马做过什么恶

641
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,150
And when we ask these questions,
当我们问这些问题时

642
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,720
we completely ignore,discard,not see the positives.
我们已经完全忽略抛弃正面的东西

643
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,720
Remember when I ask you about the geometric shapes?

646
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,310
So we know that questions create reality,
所以质疑会创造现实

647
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,000
and in order to maintain this consistency,
而为了保持一致性

00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,820
we do very often one of these two things.

650
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:49,580
positive or negative to back up our schema.
无论积极或消极 来支持我们的图式

651

652
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,340
or whatever it is that we are thinking about.
或是其他任何看法

653
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:05,360
The fourth thing is much more directly,creating a new reality.
第4件事直接得多 即创造新的现实

654
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,810
What kind of reality existed before the 6th of May,1954?

And what did Edison do,sorry,what did Bannister do?
爱迪生做...抱歉 Bannister做了什么

658
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,340
He said it's possible and then he changed the external reality.
他说可能 于是改变了外在现实

659
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,520
Not just for himself,but also for other runners in the world.

660
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,250
And suddenly a new reality was created.
突然间创造了新的现实

661
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,080
Initially the schema was four minutes is not possible,
起初的图式是4分钟不可能跑完

662
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,930
or rather four minutes is not possible

663
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,780
and everyone adhered to this schema.
而所有人都拥护这个图式

664
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,640
Roger Bannister came and said,it is possible,

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:06,140
The thing though is,that after we perform with high motivation,

668
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,970
low motivation might looking for consistency.
干劲没那么足的人可能也会寻求统一

669
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,470
All that is left us to do is interpret our performance.
我们需要解读自己表现

670
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Was it successful or not successful,and good or bad?
成功还是不成功 好还是坏

671

是赢了还是输了?哈佛加油 到底发生了什么?

677
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:49,010
This is the reality. It's objective,its objective. But then,
这就是现实 客观

678
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,760
there is also the subjective interpretation based on my beliefs.
但同时 还有由信仰决定的主观解读

679
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,260
Let me share an example with you...
举个例子

680
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,220
This is a story told about Thomas Edison.
有个关于托马斯.爱迪生的故事

681
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,760
Thomas Edison,back in the 1870's,
爱迪生于1870年代

682
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,930
was working along with the rest of the scientific community
与科学界都在研究灯泡

683
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,800
on the light bulb,on generating light from electricity.
如何用电发光

684
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,330
The entire scientific community or much of it was working
整个科学界都在研究这一课题

685
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,310
on that,on that issue,with no success,
但一无所获

686
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,640
Thomas Edison being no exception.
爱迪生也不例外

687
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,930
A journalist from one of the local papers
当地报纸的一名记者

688
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,580
came to Thomas Edison to interview.
前去采访爱迪生

689
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,580
He was already famous by then,he invented many things.
他当时已经非常有名了 发明了很多东西

690
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,290
And they were talking about various things
他们谈了各种话题

691
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,900
and then they got to talk about the light bulb.
然后开始讲灯泡问题

692
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,490
And the journalist said to Edison,"Mr. Edison,
那个记者对爱迪生说 "爱迪生先生"

693
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,260
you've been working on the light bulb for many years.
您致力于灯泡研究许多年了

694
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,550
The rest of the scientific community has been working on it,
整个科学界都在进行相同研究

695
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,970
to no avail."
但毫无所获"

696
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,000
Now at that point Thomas Edison had conducted 5000 experiments,
当时爱迪生已经进行了5000次实验

697
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,920
so,and the journalist knew that so he told Edison,
这位记者也知道 于是他对爱迪生说

698
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,890
"Mr. Edison,you've conducted 5000 experiments,
"爱迪生先生 您已经进行了5000次实验

699
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:14,160
and you failed 5000 times. Give it up."
失败了5000次 放弃吧"

700
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,200
Now Thomas Edison,some of you may know was also hard
你们可能知道 爱迪生听力不好

701
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,630
of hearing,in fact one of his patents was a hearing aid.
事实上 他有一项专利就是助听器

702
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,510
So he said to the journalist," Excuse me,what did you say?"
所以他对记者说"你说什么

703
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,860
The journalist said,"well,I said you failed 5000 times,
那个记者重复"我说你失败了5000次

704
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:37,180
give it up." So Edison responded,"I didn't fail 5000 times.
放弃吧" 爱迪生回答"我没有失败5000次

705
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,710
I succeeded 5000 times.
是成功了5000次

706
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,330
I succeeded in showing what doesn't work."
我成功证明了哪些方法行不通"

707
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:51,050
Same objective reality,performance,5000 failed experiments,
同样的客观现实 表现 5000次失败

708
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,300
but very different interpretation.
但却有完全不同的解读

709
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,770
The journalist and many other people
那个记者也其他科学界认定

710
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,500
in the scientific community conclude its not possible,
这是不可能达成的

711
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:04,410
the interpretation,subjective interpretation of Edison it's just
但爱迪生的主观解读

712
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,920
another stepping stone towards success because it is possible.
却是他走向成功的敲门砖 因为是可能的

713
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,830
In fact,Edison declared,before he had the light bulb,
事实是 爱迪生在发明灯泡前就宣布

714
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,300
that on the 31st of December,1879,
他将在1879年12月31日

715
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,940
he would display the light bulb.
展示灯泡

716
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,560
That was long before he had done it.
这是在他发明灯泡前

717
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:29,400
On the 31st of December,1879,Edison displayed to the world,
1879年12月31日 爱迪生向世界展示了

718
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,880
generating light from electricity.
用电发光

719
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:42,840
Just like in 1962,John F. Kennedy said that there would be a man
同样地 1962年 肯尼迪总统说

720

And the interpretation is,I told you so.

I told you I couldn't do well here.

784
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,030
And then everyone else in a chorus says,yes,you told us so.

But then sometimes a pessimist succeeds

787
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,750
beyond his or her expectations.
取得了成功

The interpretation is,low levels of beliefs,
这时的解释是 低水平的信念

790

so the interpretation is,well,it was lucky,

it was because Mars was in front of Venus,

50年难得一遇 不会再发生了

00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,790
So they're realistic in the short term

00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,450
as well as in the long term.
同样也在长期目标上很现实

800
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,180
Let's look at the optimist now.

In other words,unrealistic.

However,the interpretation,because of high levels of beliefs,

the subjective interpretation is,

I've gone even better this time.

5次 10次 有时5000次 甚至10000次

to match their beliefs over time.

that it's not just some pollyannaish feel-good,

但是...谢谢 谢谢 但这没有用

And again,don't get me wrong,I'm very grateful to my mom.
再一次 别误解我 我非常感激我妈妈

1000
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,070
I literally had 24/7 Marva Collins in my house.
简直就像是全天候的驻家Marva Collins

1001
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:30,290
I owe so much to my mom. However,in this case,
我是那么地感激我妈妈 但是 这一次

1002
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,550
it probably was not the realistic belief.
这可能不是现实的信念

1003
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,070
So what is realistic?
那么什么是现实的?

1004
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,760
How do we identify what is realistic and what is not?
我们如何区分什么是现实的 什么不是?

1005
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,400
Here are some ideas to help us do so.
下面是一些对我们有帮助的想法

1006

The Stockdale paradox.

reconciling the tension and it's not easy.

01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,860
Again,I'm not going to give you a formula now to tell you:
我不会给你们一个公式 告诉你们:

1010
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:01,030
OK,here is...calculate this,and if it's above seven,
好吧 就这样...算这个 如果是大于7的

1011
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,660
go ahead with green; below seven,probably not so.
就没有问题 低于7的 可能就不是这样

1012
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,560
There is no formula. But here is,just a heuristic,
不存在什么公式 但是 仅作为一个启发式

1013
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,150
something to think about when you think about beliefs.

1014
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:19,070
James Stockdale was admiral. James Stockdale was the highest

ranking prisoner of war in the... in the Vietnam War.

And he started to notice a phenomenon. He was there for years.

Eventually got out and live to tell the tale many others did not.
最终被释放并得以活着向人们讲述往事 而其他许多战俘没能做到

And he saw many people survive,many people not survive.

The very harsh conditions of the prisoner.

1020
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:46,730
What he was that the people who survived had two characteristics.

First of all,they believed that they would get out,

1022

they had faith that one day they would be free.

They would get to see their family,their friends.

And this faith kept them going.

01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,910
At the same time,and this is the second component,

1026
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:10,440
they had realistic beliefs and evaluation of the situation.
他们有着现实的信念 能对情况做出估计

1027
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:13,480
If any one of these two components were missing,
如果这两点有一点没做到

1028
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,640
they were unlikely to survive.
他们就不大可能活下来

1029
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,180
If they didn't have faith and they didn't believed it they would
如果他们没有信念 他们不相信他们会活下来

1030
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,790
survive,they were very likely to die in the harsh conditions.
他们很可能在恶劣的环境下死去

1031
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,580
On the other hand,if they thought that
另一方面 如果他们认为

1032
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,210
they would get out by this coming Christmas,and really
他们能在这年的圣诞节之前就出去

1033
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,560
believed that they would get out by this coming Christmas,

1034
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,390
they were also less likely to survive.
他们同样也不大可能幸存

1035
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:37,420
Because they didn't get out by this coming Christmas,
因为他们这年的圣诞节没有被放出去

1036
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:41,050
and then they were desponded,resigned,helpless,
他们失望 气馁 无助

1037
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,870
and very often,they died.
通常情况下 他们会死去

1038
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,770
So it was the two components,believe that you would get out,

1039
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,690
but at the same time know that you need to

deal with reality and that it's tough.

"you must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end

which you can never afford to lose

with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts

1045
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,340
of your current reality whatever they might be."

Now the thing is that you may be wrong at times.

1048
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:19,310
And sometimes you may really believe in something,

但就像我们谈到的那样...我们接下来会谈到

1052
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,690
it doesn't matter that much.
这也没太大关系

01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,440
Because even if we don't success we just bounce back up.

And continue working hard.

You see,there is a lot of belief...People believe that

01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,750
And it sounds right. I mean,this is the formula that

1107
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:17,950
was written in the 19th century by William James.

He said that self-esteem is equal to

our success over pretensions. In other words,our achievement...

how much we succeed,how much we achieve over

1112
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:42,740

1113
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:46,640
we are much more likely to hurt our self-esteem.
我们就有更大的可能伤害自己的自尊

1114
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:53,980
For example,let's say my aspiration,my pretension,

01:08:54,180 --> 01:09:01,670
my expectation is to make 4 thousand dollars a month.

1116
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,840
Again this...I just throw in a numeric

1117
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,230
example here because it's easier to understand.

Let's say my hope is to make 4 thousand dollars a month.
让我们假设我的希望是一个月挣4000美元

1119

That's my pretension.

1121
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,620
According to William James' formula,my self-esteem,
根据William James的公式 我的自尊

1122
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,210
and as we know self-esteem and happiness

1123
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,760
are very highly co-related and related.
是紧密相关的

1124
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,250

1125
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,880
according to this formula is a half.
根据这个公式便只有一半

1126
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,260
On the other hand,let's say my pretensions,
另一方面 假设我的抱负

1127
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:48,430
my expectation is to make 1.5 thousand dollars a month
我的期望是一个月挣1500美元

1128
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:56,880
and in fact I make 1.5 thousand dollars a month.
而事实上我一个月挣了1500美元

1129
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,310
According to this formula,my self-esteem,
根据这个公式 我的自尊

1130
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,480
my happiness level is 1.
我的快乐水平是1

1131
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,860
So here even though I'm making less,
尽管我挣的更少了

1132
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,910
again I'm using a numeric example here,

1133
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,720
you can think about other examples.

1134
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,170
Even though I'm actually making less here,

1135
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,550
my self-esteem and my happiness are higher.
我的自尊和我的快乐程度却变高了

1136
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,280
So lower you expectations.
